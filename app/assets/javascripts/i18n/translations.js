Sometimes this means\n  choosing a higher level taxon that contains a number of\n  disagreeing taxa (e.g. you think it's a kingsnake and I think\n  it's rattlesnake, so iNat chooses suborder Serpentes which\n  contains all snakes). The algorithm also slightly favors\n  dissent, because we've found that dissenters are often\n  correct.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"ui\"\u003e\n  The community taxon is the taxon we use when sharing observations\n  with data partners, linking observations of the same taxon on the\n  site, updating your life list, etc. If for some reason you don't\n  agree with the community taxon, you can reject it, which means\n  that your ID is the one used for linking to other observations,\n  updating life lists, etc. It also means your observation can only\n  become research grade when the community agrees with \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\n  If you don't like the whole idea of community taxa, you can opt\n  out of them entirely by \u003ca href=\"/users/edit\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eediting your settings\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"ui\"\u003e\n  \u003cstrong\u003eThe algorithm:\u003c/strong\u003e for all identified taxa and the taxa that contain them\n  (e.g. genus \u003ci\u003eHomo\u003c/i\u003e contains \u003ci\u003eHomo sapiens\u003c/i\u003e), score\n  each as the ratio between the number of cumulative IDs for\n  that taxon over the sum of the cumulative IDs, the number of\n  more conservative IDs added after the first ID of that taxon,\n  and the number of IDs that are completely different (i.e. IDs\n  of taxa that do not contain the taxon being scored).
