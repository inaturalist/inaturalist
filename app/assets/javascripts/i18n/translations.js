Scientific names can also reflect an organism's taxonomic\n  placement, so they can change when scientists develop more\n  accurate theories about the evolutionary relationships of\n  different organisms, again reducing their usefullness in\n  commuinication, even among people who know scientific names.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  The old adage sums it up: \"Common names change from place to\n  place, and scientific names change from time to time.\"\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n  We try to address these shortcomings by showing both common\n  and scientific names wherever possible, and choosing common names\n  based on the language and geographic preferences of the viewer.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","frequency":{"research":"Research Grade","verifiable":"Verifiable","Flowering Phenology=bare":"No flowers","Flowering Phenology=budding":"Budding","Flowering Phenology=flower":"Flowering","Flowering Phenology=fruit":"Fruiting","Insect life stage=egg":"Egg","Insect life stage=larva":"Larva","Insect life stage=teneral":"Teneral","Insect life stage=nymph":"Nymph","Insect life stage=pupa":"Pupa","Insect life stage=adult":"Adult","${item":{}},"no_trending_desc":"Nothing below this taxon observed in the last month","rare_desc":"Least-observed threatened taxa","rare_in_place_desc_html":"Least-observed threatened taxa in \u003ca href=\"%{url}\"\u003e%{place}\u003c/a\u003e","trending_desc":"Most-observed taxa in the last month","trending_in_place_desc_html":"Most-observed taxa in the last month in \u003ca href=\"%{url}\"\u003e%{place}\u003c/a\u003e"}}},"vulnerable":"vulnerable","we_have_no_conservation_status_for_this_taxon":"We have no conservation status for this taxon","we_have_no_establishment_data_for_this_taxon":"We have no establishment data for this taxon","white":"white","wild":"wild","withdraw":"Withdraw","x_comments":{"one":"1 comment","other":"%{count} comments"},"x_faves":{"one":"1 fave","other":"%{count} faves"},"x_identifications":{"one":"1 identification","other":"%{count} identifications"},"x_identifications_":{"one":"1 Identification","other":"%{count} Identifications"},"x_matching_taxa_html":{"one":"\u003cspan class=\"count\"\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e matching taxon","other":"\u003cspan class=\"count\"\u003e%{count}\u003c/span\u003e matching taxa"},"x_misidentifications_of_this_species":{"one":"1 misidentification of this species","other":"%{count} misidentifications of this species"},"x_observations":{"one":"1 observation","other":"%{count} observations"},"x_observations_":{"one":"1 Observation","other":"%{count} Observations"},"x_observations_failed":{"one":"1 observation failed","other":"%{count} observations failed"},"x_observations_link_html":{"one":"\u003ca href='%{url}'\u003e1 observation\u003c/a\u003e","other":"\u003ca href='%{url}'\u003e%{count} observations\u003c/a\u003e"},"x_observations_reviewed_html":{"one":"\u003cspan class='count'\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e observation reviewed","other":"\u003cspan class='count'\u003e%{count}\u003c/span\u003e observations reviewed"},"x_species":{"one":"1 species","other":"%{count} species"},"x_species_link_html":{"one":"\u003ca href='%{url}'\u003e1 species\u003c/a\u003e","other":"\u003ca href='%{url}'\u003e%{count} species\u003c/a\u003e"},"yellow":"yellow","yes":"Yes","yesterday":"Yesterday","you_appear_offline_try_again":"You appear to be offline.

These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,\n  and stable over time, but many organisms have several different\n  names in different places, even in the same language, which can make\n  it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.\n  Scientists address this problem by using a single \"scientific name\"\n  for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of\n  \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature\"\u003ebiological nomenclature\u003c/a\u003e,\n  but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody\n  speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many\n  people.

These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,\n  and stable over time, but many organisms have several different\n  names in different places, even in the same language, which can make\n  it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.\n  Scientists address this problem by using a single \"scientific name\"\n  for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of\n  \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature\"\u003ebiological nomenclature\u003c/a\u003e,\n  but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody\n  speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many\n  people.

These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,\n  and stable over time, but many organisms have several different\n  names in different places, even in the same language, which can make\n  it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.\n  Scientists address this problem by using a single \"scientific name\"\n  for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of\n  \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature\"\u003ebiological nomenclature\u003c/a\u003e,\n  but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody\n  speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many\n  people.
