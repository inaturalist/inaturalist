      <h5><a name="general1">What is iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist provides a place to record and organize nature findings,
        meet other nature enthusiasts, and learn about the natural world. It
        encourages the participation of a wide variety of nature
        enthusiasts, including, but not exclusive to, hikers, hunters,
        birders, beach combers, mushroom foragers, park rangers, ecologists,
        and fishermen. Through connecting these different perceptions and
        expertise of the natural world, iNaturalist hopes to create
        extensive community awareness of local biodiversity and promote
        further exploration of local environments.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="general2">Who is behind iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist was originally the Master'ss Final Project of Nathan Agrin,
        Jessica Kline, and Ken-ichi Ueda at UC Berkeley's 
        <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu">School of Information</a>.
        Currently Ken-ichi maintains the project, with occasional help
        and guidance from Nate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="general3">What technologies and data sources does the project use?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist is built using <a
        href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a
        href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a
        href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a
        href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps//">Google Maps</a>, and <a
        href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. It also utilizes the <a
        href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org">Catalogue of Life</a> and
        <a href="http://ubio.org/">uBio</a> data sources for taxonomic data.
      </p>

    <li>
      <h5><a name="general4">What can I do to help iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        You can help iNaturalist by giving us your feedback; join our 
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/inaturalist">Google group</a> 
        to sign up for usability studies, report bugs, and request new
        features. You can also help iNaturalist by adding your observations
        and helping other community members identify their unidentified
        observations. If you know how to code and want to help work on some
        features,
        <a href="http://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist" title="inaturalist's inaturalist at master - GitHub">fork us on GitHub</a>!

      <h5><a name="general5">How do I contact iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        You can contact us at <a href="mailto:<%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %>"><%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %></a>
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <a name="curators"></a>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="general6">What are admins and curators?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNat admins are the people who run the site. They have direct access
        to the underlying code and the database, and they can change anything
        on the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curators are iNat users who volunteer to help keep our taxonomic data
        up to date. If you're interested in becoming a curator, please 
        <a href="mailto:<%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %>">contact us</a>. Curators can
        also promote other users to curator status. Please only promote people
        you trust and that you know to have some taxonomic knowledge.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h5><a name="inappropriate">What is considered inappropriate content?</a></h5>
      <p>
        You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">know it when you see it</a>, 
        right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
        is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
        the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
        probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
        animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
        interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
        that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
        nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth
        flagging and may be deleted, but evidence of pollution or disturbance
        could be interesting, and probably won't be removed.
      </p>

  <h4>
    Observations
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations1">What is an observation?</a></h5>
      <p>An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. iNaturalist provides a place to add this information along with associated text, photos, and tags. iNaturalist encourages the recording of all nature findings, whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. (In iNaturalist the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations2">Why doesn't iNaturalist recognize the name I've entered?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
        and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
        database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
        alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
        name to the tags or description fields.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations3">How can I get help identifying what I saw?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
        observation and your observation will appear in
        <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/id_please" title="<%= APP_CONFIG[:site_name] %> &middot; ID Please!">ID Please</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations4">What does it mean to link iNaturalist to my Flickr account?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
        that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
        you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
        two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
        you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
        to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations5">Can I add photos without a Flickr account?</a></h5>
      <p>
        We also support Picasa: <a href="http://inaturalist.org/picasa/options">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also support uploading photos directly to iNat, but it can be a bit
        slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Picasa is
        probably faster if you already use those services.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations6">What are tags?</a></h5>
      <p>Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations7">Can I include my iNat observations on my own website of blog?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Sure, check out our <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/widget" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations8">What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
        at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
        tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
        observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
        different point in time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
        obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
        copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
        of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
        photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
        someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
        it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
        observation's description.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h5><a name="geoprivacy">What is geoprivacy?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
        controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
        displayed. Here are the options:
      </p>
      <dl class="readable">
        <% for privacy, description in Observation::GEOPRIVACY_DESCRIPTIONS %>
          <dt><%= privacy || "open" %></dt>
          <dd><%= description %></dd>
        <% end %>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
        coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
        concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
        you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h5><a name="obscured">What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?</a></h5>
      <p>
        When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
        <%= Observation::M_TO_OBSCURE_THREATENED_TAXA / 1000 %>KM of the true coordinates 
        is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
        project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
        are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
        pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
        the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
        true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
        circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
        THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
        declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
        some may be simply marked as threatened by iNat site curators if they
        believe it merits protection.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
        regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.

  <h4>
    Lists
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="lists1">What is a life list?</a></h5>
      <p>A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every iNaturalist user has a life list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to iNaturalist.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="lists2">I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?</a></h5>
      <p>
        While the life list is automatically populated from added
        observations, the species will not be added to this list if
        iNaturalist does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
        trying alternative names that we might recognize.
