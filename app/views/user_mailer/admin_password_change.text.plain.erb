Because we recently changed our user authentication system, it was necessary for your password to be reset.

We know this is an inconvenience, but our new authorization system will allow <%= APP_CONFIG[:site_name] %> to grow well into the future and provide you with some added security.

A few points to make things a bit clearer:
* No <%= APP_CONFIG[:site_name] %> administrator knows your new password or at any point had or has access to your password.
* Aside from extraordinary circumstances, we well never ask you for your password.

Your new password is: <%=h @user.password %>

You can change your new password after logging in here: <%= login_url %>

Thanks for using <%= APP_CONFIG[:site_name] %>!
