  <h3>Link your Flickr account with <%= CONFIG.site_name %> so you can add photos of your
  observations.</h3>
  <p>Flickr is an online photo hosting service, maybe you already know about
  it!</p>
  <p>In order to authorize your Flickr account to work with <%= CONFIG.site_name %>, you
  need to click on the button to the right and either create a Flickr account
  or sign into Flickr.com. Flickr will ask you if you want to give <%= CONFIG.site_name %>
  permission to read from your Flickr account and will then redirect you back
  to us.</p>
  <h3>We Care About Your Privacy!</h3>
  <ul class="readable">
    <li>
      <strong>We will never ask you for your Flickr password</strong> (but
      Flickr might, check the url that the button sends you and make sure it's
      Flickr.com).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>We will never store copies of your photos or change your Flickr
      data (unless you ask us to), ever.</strong> We care too much about birds, bugs and slugs to
      want to mess with your information!
