        %strong TTCID
        is time to receive an identification from someone else that matches the community taxon.
        These stats are made for observations created for a week prior, which means it will miss identifications added to observations after more than a week, and thus make the stats look lower than they would if you computed them again in the present, but they should still provide a decent measure for how fast the community is at identifying within 1 week windows.

        Note that these stats are only for observations with photos.
