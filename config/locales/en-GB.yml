    Only your observations in this project that have obscured coordinates

    Many projects just need access to coordinates that are obscured because the

  about_trusting_projects_overview: |-
    Granting access to your hidden coordinates will allow the managers of this
    project to see the true, unobscured location of your observations in this
    project. This is extremely important in situations where scientists or
    resource managers need access to exact coordinates for analysis and
    decision-making.

    of your observations, and they can add or remove project managers at any

  app_owner_application_about_p1a_html: |
    iNaturalist apps allow authenticated use of the iNaturalist API. This allows you to make API calls that do things like create observations or identifications. Usual use cases are apps such as desktop apps or mobile apps that include functionality for their user(s) to create iNaturalist observations. This content must be generated with real human involvement or oversight. Please read our <a href="/pages/community+guidelines"
    target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a> prohibiting machine-generated observations, identifications, and comments for more details.
  app_owner_application_about_p2_html: |
    As of 2022 we are requiring manual approval for users wishing to make API clients. In order to create third-party apps, you must first submit an application to become an "app owner." This application should describe the functionality of your proposed app and how you plan to use it. In order to submit an application your account must be at least 2 months old and must have made at least 10 <a href="/pages/help#identification"
    target="_blank">improving identifications</a> in the last month. We may ask follow-up questions about your plan and we reserve the right to turn down applications for any reason.

  #thinned refers to a branch of the taxonomy that has lost descendants because they are moved elsewhere
  clashes_occur_for_moves_html: |
    Unintended disagreements occur when a parent <strong>(B)</strong> is
    thinned by moving a child <strong>(E)</strong> to another part of the
    taxonomic tree, resulting in existing IDs of the parent being interpreted
    as disagreements with existing IDs of the moved child.
  #thinned refers to a branch of the taxonomy that has lost descendants because of a taxon swap with another taxon
  clashes_occur_for_swaps_html: |
    Unintended disagreements occur when a parent <strong>(B)</strong> is
    thinned by swapping a child <strong>(E)</strong> to another part of the
    taxonomic tree, resulting in existing IDs of the parent being interpreted
    as disagreements with existing IDs of the swapped child.

  #Status of a taxon that the Computer Vision Model cannot yet recognize

    The current Computer Vision Model does not know about this taxon, so while
    it might be included in automated suggestions with the "Expected Nearby" label, it
    will not have the "Visually Similar" label. While the requirements for
    model inclusion change with each model, generally inclusion is based on
    number of observations, so to increase the chance of this taxon getting
    included during the next model training, add or identify more observations
    of this taxon.
