          How did this year compare to your previous years? With three years of
          usage or more we can start comparing yearly activity metrics. The
          green bar shows this year, the white vertical bar shows last year, and
          the grey background areas show the lowest and highest years, as well
          as the average for all years. Stats do not include years where the
          count was zero.
