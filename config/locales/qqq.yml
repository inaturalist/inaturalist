    '''FIXME:''' The end of sentence, assuming this is followed by a partner name and nothing else after it, is grammatically incorrect in several languages.  As well the final "the" is untranslatable out of context, and should be avoided. This is a "patchwork" message (only suitable for English and never tested to be really translatable correctly), which should be fixed by including a placeholder for the data partner name(s), like there's one for the site name. For now we need to remove "the" and formulate the sentence as if it was a colon, separating the partner name from the introduction sentence.
