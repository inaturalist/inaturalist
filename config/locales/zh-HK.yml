  #Used as a noun phrase in sentences like "kueda added a comment to *an
  #observation*". %{resource} could be any of the following:
  #* assessment_section
  #* atlas
  #* listed_taxon
  #* observation
  #* observation_field
  #* post
  #* taxon_change
  #* taxon_drop
  #* taxon_link
  #* taxon_merge
  #* taxon_split
  #* taxon_stage
  #* taxon_swap
  #Note that you can also control for gender like @gender{m:un|f:une|n:un(e)}
  #to add masculine, feminine, and neuter forms of articles. I realize this is
  #an awkward way to translate something, but fixing it will have to wait for
  #an overhaul of our notification system.
