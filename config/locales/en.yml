    <h4>
      Trips enable the collection of presence-absence data by adding context to
      your observations
    </h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Why</strong> Presence-absence data include information about
      sampling effort which is useful for scientific analyses like distribution
      modeling (raw iNaturalist observations are 'presence-only' data).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How</strong> A trip adds context to your observations by recording:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> you searched for (target list)</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> you searched (search area)</li>
      <li><strong>When</strong> you searched (search interval)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Species on your target list that you were able to observe within the
      search area and interval are interpreted as presences. While species on
      your target list that you were unable to observe are interpreted as
      absences. Click 'Tabulate Presence Absence Data From Trips' to generate a
      table of presence-absence records for a species from trips and associated
      observations. <a href='%{url}'>Learn more</a>

    This includes observations where you have set the geoprivacy to "obscured"
    or "private," e.g. observations from your backyard or spots you don't want
    other people to know about.
  about_trusting_projects_options_taxon: |-
    Only your observations in this project that have obscured coordinates
    because of threatened taxa
  about_trusting_projects_options_taxon_desc: |-
    Many projects just need access to coordinates that are obscured because the
    observation depicts a threatened taxon.
  about_trusting_projects_overview: |-
    Granting access to your hidden coordinates will allow the managers of this
    project to see the true, unobscured location of of your observations in this
    project. This is extremely important in situations where scientists or
    resource managers need access to exact coordinates for analysis and
    decision-making.

  about_trusting_projects_warning: |-
    Note that project managers can change the project parameters to include any
    of your observations, and they can add or remove project managers at any
    time. You will receive notifications about these changes, but you are
    essentially trusting this project with your private location data, so be

    iNaturalist site curators are trusted volunteers who have the ability to
    edit iNaturalist's taxonomy and moderate user content. Site curators are
    integral to iNaturalist, as they keep our taxonomy up-to-date and the
    discourse on iNaturalist appropriate and civil. Below is a description
    of what being a curator means. Please read it and, if you would like to
    be a curator, carefully read through the

  # Verb, usually a button to hide an interface element

  hide_content: Hide Content
  hide_desc: |
    Hiding content will remove it from public view, but people will still be
    able to see that something was hidden, and site curators and the author of
    the content will still be able to see the hidden content. Generally, this
    only applies to written content, e.g. if you hide the content of an
    identification, the identification is still visible but the identifier's
    remarks are hidden. You cannot undo this, and only site staff can unhide
    content once it has been hidden, so be careful and only use this for very
    objectionable content.

  locked_taxa_will_not_allow_new: Locked taxa will not allow new descendent taxa to be added to them. So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

  places_warning_export_complex_boundary_html: |
    If you're trying to export observations from a complex boundary, consider
    <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7">downloading them from GBIF instead</a>,
    where you can draw arbitrary boundaries, or export them from iNat using
    existing places or a bounding box and then filter the data again once you've
    downloaded it.
  places_warning_look_for_existing_html: |
    Look for <a href="/search?source[]=places">existing places</a> to make sure
    you're not creating a duplicate. We already have places for all the
    continents and countries, as well as two administrative levels below
    country.
  places_warning_projects_can_have_multiple_places: |
    If you're trying to make a place for a project boundary, projects can be
    composed of multiple places. For example, if you want to make a project for
    New Zealand and Australia, you can just add requirements for two places
    instead of making a new one.
  places_warning_new_places_are_slow_html: |
    New places are one of the biggest sources of slowdowns on iNat, so
    <strong>please consider not making a new place</strong>. While small places
    containing only a few thousand observations are usually ok, if you make a
    new place that contains a lot of observations, you're going to slow iNat
    down for everyone else. Here are some alternative approaches:
  places_warning_editing_places_is_slow: |
    Editing place boundaries is one of the biggest sources of slowdowns on iNat.
    If you can avoid it, do not add, change, or remove place boundaries unless
    it's absolutely necessary.
  places_warning_the_future: |
    For what it's worth, we will have to restrict the conditions under which
    people can add places in the future given iNat's current rate of growth.

          not all of which are available for every taxon. Choosing "Overview"

        import_tags_from_csv_help_html: |
          <p>
            Upload a CSV file containing tags for taxa in this guide. Your CSV file should look like this:

              <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>color</th>
                <th>Number of hands</th>
                <th></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Homo sapiens</td>
                <td></td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>bipedal</td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            The first row starts with "Name" followed by the tag
            predicates/categories. Then each following row starts with the
            name of taxon, followed by tags corresponding predicate the top
            of the column. In this example, <i>Homo sapiens</i> gets the
            tags <code>bipedal</code> and <code>Number of hands=2</code>,
            and <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> gets <code>quadripedal</code>,
            <code>color=red</code>, <code>color=black</code>, and
            <code>Number of hands=0</code>. Blanks will be ignored, and you
            can add multiple lines per taxon. You can also add multiple
            values per cell separated by the pipe character.

        licensing_explanation: |
          Licensing your content grants other people the right to copy and
          modify it without asking your permission. It makes it much easier to
          share your work, and if you incorporate 3rd party content from other
          sources that use Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses (like
          Wikipedia), you are legally obliged to use a similar license. Here's
          an overview of all the Creative Commons licenses and what they mean:
        paste_note_html: |
          Paste in up to 500 species names, one per line. %{site_name} will do
          its best to match common names to species concepts, but to avoid
          ambiguity it's better to use scientific names. If you want to
          specify them both, separate the scientific name from the common name
          with a comma, like <code>Homo sapiens,Human</code>.
        places_note: |
          Note: not all places have check lists with taxa. If you're having
          trouble finding a place with taxa, try choosing larger areas with
          political boundaries, like nations, states, provinces, or counties.
        replace_existing_eol_desc: Delete existing content before importing from EOL
        place_choose_taxon_note: |
          Choose a taxon to filter by if you want to narrow your search, e.g. "plants"

          <p>
            If for some reason a user doesn't agree with the community taxon,
            they can reject it, which means their ID is the one used for
            linking to other observations, updating life lists, etc. It also
            means their observation can only become research grade when the
            community agrees with them.

          has an observation of Homo sapiens and Query 2 has an observation of
          Genus Homo, both taxa will be present in the table, but that
          represents one additional  row for Genus Homo for Query 1, which
          didn't include it in its total count because it only counted the
          species Homo sapiens within that genus, because that was the "leaf" of
          that part of its tree.

                GBIF ingests most of our Research Grade, licensed observations,
                and their export tools are excellent. GBIF exports also come
                with a <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> you can cite if
                you publish research based on the data you export, and these
                citations are enormously helpful to us as they allow us to see
                how iNat data gets used.

          also removed text search and numerical pagination. On top of that,
          they required all connected accounts to have an additional permission,
          and before a third party can request that permission from users, the
          third party has to be verified. We are awaiting verification, but
          until that happens, you will not be able to import photos from Google.
          If we get approved, you will be able to import photos, but they won't
          include any location information or license information that you might
          be able to see on Google Photos. You can read more about this at <a

            The community taxon (or community identification) represents
            what taxon the %{site_name} community thinks is depicted in an
            observation. If you're interested in how we choose the
            community taxon, see the notes on the algorithm below, but in
            general, we try to <strong>choose a taxon that more than 2/3
            of the identifiers agree with</strong>. Sometimes this means
            choosing a higher level taxon that contains a number of
            disagreeing taxa (e.g. you think it's a kingsnake and I think
            it's rattlesnake, so iNat chooses suborder Serpentes which
            contains all snakes). The algorithm also slightly favors
            dissent, because we've found that dissenters are often
            correct.

          <p class="ui">
            A research grade observation must have (among other criteria) a
            community taxon. If an observation has
            only one identification, it won’t have a community taxon. All
            observations with at least one identification will also have an
            observation taxon. The observation taxon is the taxon we use when
            sharing observations with data partners, linking observations of
            the same taxon on the site, updating your life list, etc. In most
            cases the observation taxon will eventually be set to the community
            taxon, but sometimes they will differ especially before the community
            has settled on an identification. For example, if you think
            its a snake (suborder Serpentes) and I think it’s a kingsnake (genus
            <i>Lampropeltis</i>) the observation taxon will be at kingsnake (supported
            by my identification only) but the community taxon will be at
            serpentes (supported by at least two identifications). If for
            some reason you don't agree with the community taxon, you can
            reject it on your own observations, which means that observation
            taxon will never be set to the community taxon (rather your own ID).
            It also means your observation can only become research grade when the community
            agrees with <em>you</em>. If you don't like the whole idea of
            community taxa, you can opt out of them entirely by
            <a href="/users/edit" target="_blank">editing your settings</a>.

            IDs, ‘disagreements’ - the number of IDs that are completely different (i.e. IDs of taxa

          <ul>
            <li>
              the %{site_name} <strong>community agrees on species-level ID or
              lower</strong>, i.e. when more than 2/3 of identifiers agree on a
              taxon (if the community has voted that the Community Taxon can no
              longer be improved, this reverts to subfamily-level ID or lower)

              the <strong>location doesn't look

              hippos in office buildings, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              the <strong>organism isn't wild/naturalized</strong> (e.g. captive or cultivated by humans

            <li>
              the observation <strong>doesn't present recent (~100 years) evidence of
              the organism</strong> (e.g. fossils, but tracks, scat, and dead leaves

            </li>
            <li>
              the observation no longer needs an ID <em>and</em> the community ID is above family

              the observer has opted out of the community ID and the community

              The system will vote that the observation is not wild/naturalized

              the smallest county-, state-, or country-equivalent place that
              contains this observation and 80% or more of those observations

            but your child will not be able to contribute observations to
            iNaturalist. iNaturalist is a citizen-science social network where

                After you create your child's account, we will ask you to make a
                small donation of US$1 with a credit card to iNaturalist to verify

        bioblitz_results_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Unlike regular projects, bioblitzes display event stats from
            <em>all</em> observations within a place and time period, not just
            observations that people have intentionally added to the project.
            This is to remove the hurdle of adding observations to a project
            just to drive the stats in real time. Note that observations won't
            be available for export or display on various project views such
            as member contributions on the website or project observation
            searches in the mobile apps unless the project team and
            participants actively add relevant observations like they would in
            a normal project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that while this kind of project shows stats for observations that
            haven't been deliberately added to the project, it does not allow
            curators to see private or obscured coordinates for those
            observations or assume that observers have agreed to the project
            terms. If you're a project curator and you need access to private
            coordinates, you need your participants to agree to the project
            terms, or you want observations counted towards the curated project checklist,
            make sure your participants join the project and add their
            observations like they would in a normal project.

        growth_by_country_desc_html: |
          Where is growth happening? This map and chart attempt to break this
          down by country, which turns out to be complicated because growth by
          country can be very imbalanced. Here we've chosen to omit the United
          States and use a log scale by default to accentuate differences
          between other countries. If a country is colored black that means it
          did not contribute signicantly to a percentage, or it had no growth
          this year, or did not have more observations this year than last year
          (hover over a country to see a little more detail). <strong>"% of
          total growth"</strong> means how much of worldwide growth came from a
          particular country, e.g. if there were 20 observations in 2018 and 10
          in 2017, that would be 10 observations of growth, and if 5 of those
          observations were from Benin, then Benin contributed 50% of total
          growth. <strong>"% growth"</strong> means the number of observations
          this year in that country as a percent of observations last year in
          that country, so if there were 10 observations in Laos last year but
          20 this year, that would be 100% growth, and if there were 0 last year
          and 1 this year, that's infinity % growth.

        about_names_desc: |
          <p>
            Most categories of organisms have "common names" in spoken
            languages. These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,
            and stable over time, but many organisms have several different
            names in different places, even in the same language, which can make
            it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.
            Scientists address this problem by using a single "scientific name"
            for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature">biological nomenclature</a>,
            but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody
            speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many
            people. Scientific names can also reflect an organism's taxonomic
            placement, so they can change when scientists develop more
            accurate theories about the evolutionary relationships between
            different organisms, again reducing their usefulness in
            communication, even among people who know scientific names.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old adage sums it up: "Common names change from place to
            place, and scientific names change from time to time."
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to address these shortcomings by showing both common
            and scientific names wherever possible, and choosing common names
            based on the language and geographic preferences of the viewer.
          </p>
        about_conservation_status_desc: |
          The conservation status summarizes the risk of extinction for a group of organisms.
        about_establishment_desc: |
          "Establishment means" describes how a species arrived where it
          currently occurs. Introduced means it arrived because of human
          activity, while native means it arrived without human assistance.
          Endemic species only occur in a specific place and nowhere else.

          contact one of these people.
        charts_help_seasonality: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon grouped by
          month. Keep in mind that these are numbers of observations, so they
          are influenced both by when the organism can be observed and when
          people bother to observe them. So a bird might seem to be very active
          in May, but that could also be due to more people birding in May who
          tend to ignore that species in later months. Similarly, if you see
          more dragonflies in June than in January, that's probably because we
          have more people observing in the northern hemisphere than in the
          southern hemisphere and not because dragonflies are more active in
          June, so check the map when considering these charts. It's always a
          good idea to be skeptical of these charts when there are low numbers
          of observations and/or large discrepancies between the number of
          "Verifiable" and "Research Grade" observations.
        charts_help_history: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon by month for
          the last ten years. Again, it is biased by the number of people
          observing, but it will show you unusual spikes in observations, and if
          it seems flat or decreasing despite an increasing number of observers,
          that might suggest a change in abundance.
        charts_help_other: |
          We also show seasonality charts for observation annotations.
          Annotations are a way to add metadata to observations using
          a controlled vocabulary of terms, e.g. whether an observation depicts
          a plant that is flowering or fruiting.
        charts_help_relative_observations: |
          Showing frequency as a relative proportion of all observations helps
          smooth out the effect of the overall growth of the site. For example,
          if the site is growing as we get more observations with every passing
          year, we get more observations of any individual taxon, which doesn't
          tell you anything about whether there are more of that taxon around to
          observe, just that there are more people observing it. Showing the
          relative proportion means that if there are 100 observations total but
          20 observations of this taxon, the proportion is 0.2 (20 / 100). If
          people observe 2000 observations the next year and 400 observations of
          this taxon, the proportion is still 0.2 (400 / 2000). This causes some
          aberrations when there are very few observers in an area, or for taxa
          that are very infrequently observed, but that's true of total counts
          as well.
        complete_taxon_desc: |
          "Complete" taxa have all of their descendant, extant taxa of a
          specific rank present in the site's database. When a taxon is
          complete to species, for example, we can say how many of its species
          have been observed and how many still need to be observed. Counts of
          species for "complete" taxa complete to species do not include
          "uncountable" species like extinct species or inactive species
          concepts, and they only include species, not infraspecific taxa like
          subspecies or varieties.

        move_children_desc_html: |
          Checking this box will move the children of the input taxon to the
          output taxon for Swaps and Merges when this change is committed. If
          this change to a genus or lower, it will create Taxon Swaps for all
          descendants that have an implied name change. For example, if you swap
          the family Canidae into Dogidae, this change the parent of the genus
          <i>Canis</i> from Canidae to Dogidae. If you swap the genus
          <i>Canis</i> into the genus <i>Dogis</i>, it will create and commit
          Taxon Swaps to change <i>Canis lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> and
          <i>Canis lupus</i> ssp. <i>lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> ssp.
          <i>lupus</i>. This can cause quite a mess, so use with care.

        blocking_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Blocking someone prevents them from messaging you, commenting on your
            observations, identifying your observations, and otherwise interacting
            with you on %{site_name}. It also removes their observations from your
            search results and removes your observations from their search
            results. However, it does not make you invisible to them. They can
            still find your observations and view your profile, they just can't
            interact with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blocking is for situations where you just can't get along with
            someone and they won't leave you alone, despite your best efforts to
            settle disputes in a civilized manner. It is not a way to hide from
            people, to prevent identifications from people whose opinions you
            don't trust, or to opt out of the community ID (there's another
            setting for that). Thus, blocking works both ways: if you block
            someone, they can't interact with you, but you also can't interact
            with them. If you misuse it to prevent someone from identifying your
            observations, you also prevent yourself from identifying their
            observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only block three people. We think this is a reasonable
            number that accommodates the people who need blocking while
            preventing abuse of blocking. If you feel you need to block more
            people, please <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>.

          Remember, this does not give projects permission to access your
          hidden coordinates or send you updates. You must join projects in
          order to grant these permissions, or grant them on a case-by-case

          When taxa are merged or renamed on %{site_name}, your observations, listed
          taxa, identifications, etc. will be automatically updated to the new
          taxa if the change is unambiguous. If you opt out or the change is
          ambiguous (e.g. a split), you will receive an update about the
          change linking to a tool you can use to manually update your content
          if you choose.

            We want to welcome new users, but we also want to combat
            spammers. Hopefully this tool will help with both. We are
            automatically flagging many users as spammers using <a
            href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, but Akismet isn't perfect,
            so if you want to put in a few minutes marking new accounts as
            spammers or not spammers, it would help.

            Thanks for being an iNaturalist donor! We were able to use your
            existing donation to confirm your identity, and don't need any
            further action from you. <strong>Your child's account has been
            activated.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please log into the account from your child's Seek app by tapping
            the "iNaturalist" button in the menu and then "Log in with
            iNaturalist" at the bottom of the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your child will then be able to post observations to their
            iNaturalist account using the Seek app so that they can be seen on
            iNaturalist.org.

        step1_title: CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR YOUR CHILD
        step1_desc: |
          In order to comply with privacy regulations, we need a parent or legal
          guardian's consent to create an account for a person under the age of
          13. If you would like your child to use iNaturalist, you must provide
          us with some identity and contact information.
        step2_title: CONFIRM YOUR IDENTITY WITH A CREDIT CARD
        step2_desc: |
          To confirm your identity as an adult, we need you to provide a nominal
          donation of at least US$1 to iNaturalist using a credit card. This is
          the least intrusive form of identity verification that allows us to
          comply with privacy laws. Please be sure to use the same email
          address you entered as the "parent email" in the previous step.
        step3_title: WAIT FOR THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL
        step3_desc: |
          Once we match the email used in the donation to the email you entered
          as the "parent email" we will activate the child's account and send
          the parent an email with login instructions. This can take up to 24
          hours.
        step3_donor_title: YOUR CHILD'S ACCOUNT HAS BEEN ACTIVATED
        step3_donor_desc: |
          Because you're an iNaturalist donor, we were able to verify your
