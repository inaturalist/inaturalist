  locked_taxa_will_not_allow_new: Locked taxa will not allow new descendent taxa to be added to them. So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

     taxon in that place, kind of like a dynamic field guide to the entire
     planet. Most %{place} check lists are works in progress, but if there's one

            tags <code>bipedal</code> and <code>Number of hands=2</code>,
            and <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> gets <code>quadripedal</code>,
            <code>color=red</code>, <code>color=black</code>, and
            <code>Number of hands=0</code>. Blanks will be ignored, and you
            can add multiple lines per taxon. You can also add multiple
            values per cell separated by the pipe character.

        paste_note_html: |
          Paste in up to 500 species names, one per line. %{site_name} will do
          its best to match common names to species concepts, but to avoid
          ambiguity it's better to use scientific names. If you want to
          specify them both, separate the scientific name from the common name
          with a comma, like <code>Homo sapiens,Human</code>.
        places_note: |
          Note: not all places have check lists with taxa. If you're having
          trouble finding a place with taxa, try choosing larger areas with
          political boundaries, like nations, states, provinces, or counties.

        what_are_admins_and_curators?: What are admins and curators?
        inat_admins_are_the_people_who: |
          %{site_name} admins are the people who run the site. They have direct access
          to the underlying code and the database, and they can change anything
          on the site.
        curators_are_inat_users_who_volunteer_to_html: |
          Curators are %{site_name} users who volunteer to help keep our taxonomic data
          up to date. If you're interested in becoming a curator, please 
          <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>. Curators can
          also promote other users to curator status. Please only promote people
          you trust and that you know to have some taxonomic knowledge.
        what_is_considered_inappropriate_content?: What is considered inappropriate content?
        you_know_it_when_you_see_it_html: | 
          You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">know it when you see it</a>, 
          right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
          is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
          the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
          probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
          animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
          interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
          that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
          nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth
          flagging and may be deleted, but evidence of pollution or disturbance
          could be interesting, and probably won't be removed.
        what_is_an_observation?: What is an observation?
        an_observation_is_the_what_where_and_when_html: |
          An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. 
          %{site_name} provides a place to add this information along with associated text, 
          photos, and tags. %{site_name} encourages the recording of all nature findings, 
          whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. 
          (In %{site_name} the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well 
          as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;)
        why_doesnt_inaturalist_recognize_the_name_ive_entered?: "Why doesn't %{site_name} recognize the name I've entered?"
        inaturalist_has_name_information_for_mammals:  |
          %{site_name} has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
          and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
          database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
          alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
          name to the tags or description fields.
        how_can_i_get_help_identifying_what_i_saw?: How can I get help identifying what I saw?
        check_the_id_please_checkbox_when_html: | 
          Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
          observation and your observation will appear in
          <a href="%{url}">ID Please</a>.
        what_does_it_mean_to_link_inaturalist_to_my_flickr_account?: What does it mean to link %{site_name} to my Flickr account?
        inaturalist_can_link_directly_to_the_flickr_photo_service: | 
          %{site_name} can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
          that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
          you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
          two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
          you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
          to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
        can_i_add_photos_without_a_flickr_account?: Can I add photos without a Flickr account?
        we_also_support_google_html:  'We also support Google Photos: <a href="%{url}">Configure your Google account &raquo;</a>'
        we_also_support_uploading_photos: |
                We also support uploading photos directly to %{site_name}, but it can be a bit
                slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Google is
                probably faster if you already use those services.
        what_are_tags?:  What are tags?
        tags_are_keywords_you_can_add_to_an_html: |
          Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. 
          For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, 
          you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.
        can_i_include_my_observations_on_my_blog?: Can I include my %{site_name} observations on my own website of blog?
        sure_check_out_our_widget_html: |
          Sure, check out our <a href="%{url}" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
        what_kind_of_photos_should_i_attach: What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?
        photos_attached_to_observations_should_be: | 
          Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
          at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
          tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
          observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
          different point in time.
        please_do_not_upload_pictures_you_didnt_take_html: | 
          Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
          obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
          copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
          of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
          photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
          someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
          it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
          observation's description.
        what_is_geoprivacy?: What is geoprivacy?
        geoprivacy_is_a_setting_you_can: |
          Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
          controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
          displayed. Here are the options:
        note_that_curators_of: | 
          Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
          coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
          concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
          you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
        what_is_does_it_mean_for: What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?
        when_coordinates_are_obscured_it_means_that: |
          When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
          %{km}KM of the true coordinates 
          is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
          project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
          are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
          pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
          the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
          true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
          circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
        coordinates_are_obscured_for_all_taxa: | 
          Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
          THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
          declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
          some may be simply marked as threatened by %{site_name} site curators if they
          believe it merits protection.
        you_can_also_obscure_the_coordinates_html: | 
          You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
          regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.
        what_is_the_quality_assessment: What is the quality assessment and how do observations qualify to become "research" grade?
        what_is_a_life_list?: What is a life list?
        just_a_simple_list: Just a simple list of taxa with no special behavior.
        automatically_updates_based_on_your_observations: |
          Automatically updates based on your observations. Everyone on %{site_name}
          has a default life list that contains every species that person has
          observed. If you delete an observation or change your ID, the
          species will get removed. You can also manually add taxa to your
          life list just like you can with an ordinary list. The species you
          add manually won't get removed if you observe them and then delete
          the observation.
        you_can_also_make_additional_life_lists: |
          You can also make additional life lists for specific groups of
          organisms, like a life list of birds, or a life list of milkweeds.
        a_project_list_belongs: |
          A project list belongs to a project and lists all the taxa
          observed by members of that project. Project lists can also be
          populated manually by the admin of that project, and can be used
          to restrict project contributions to taxa that are on the list.
        a_check_list_is_html: |
          A check list is a list of taxa that occur in a place. Every place
          has a default check list, and whenever an observation is made
          within the place's boundaries <em>and</em> it has achieved
          research-grade status, the species observed will get automatically
          added to the place's check list.
        inat_users_can_also: |
          %{site_name} users can also add additional check lists to places, but
          these check lists are not automatically updated. They mainly
          provide a way for people to bring in outside sources of data or
          just list things based on their own experience.
        is_a_list_of_every_species_that_you_have_seen: |
          A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every %{site_name} user has a life 
          list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to %{site_name}.
        i_observed_a_species: "I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?"
        while_the_life_list_is_automatically_populated: |
                While the life list is automatically populated from added
                observations, the species will not be added to this list if
                %{site_name} does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
                trying alternative names that we might recognize.
    listed_taxa:
      establishment_field:
        confirmation: |
          Are you sure? This will change the establishment means for ALL
          listed taxa belonging to places within this place. You could be
          undoing a lot of work.
        description_html: |
          This will change the establishment means of <em>all</em> listings of
          this taxon on all descendant places of 
          <a href="%{place_url}">%{place_name}</a> 
          to <strong>"%{establishment_means}"</strong>. Only
          curators can use this tool. Changing the establishment means to
          "introduced" will have roughly the same effect, but it won't change
          existing values, just fill in blank ones.
    lists:
      new:
        place_desc: |
          Automatically populate this list with taxa observed in this place.
          Note that you can only choose places that have boundaries.
      show:
        project_list_desc: |
          Taxa manually added by project curators and taxa represented by
          research-grade observations added to the project are listed on project lists.

        explanation: |
          <p>
            If for some reason a user doesn't agree with the community taxon,
            they can reject it, which means their ID is the one used for
            linking to other observations, updating life lists, etc. It also
            means their observation can only become research grade when the
            community agrees with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the community ID is still shown, so all may see the
            different IDs that have been suggested.

        coordinate_systems_help: |
          %{site_name} accepts coordinates using several different coordinate
          systems, so when you provide coordinates in a system other than
          latitude / longitude, we need to know which coordinate system you're
          using to be able to interpret them correctly. Please be certain you
          have chosen the correct coordinate system for your data or the
          location may finish up a long way from where it should be. If your
          coordinates are from a GPS unit, check its settings for the name of

        community_taxon_desc_html: |
          <p class="ui">
            The community taxon (or community identification) represents
            what taxon the %{site_name} community thinks is depicted in an
            observation. If you're interested in how we choose the
            community taxon, see the notes on the algorithm below, but in
            general, we try to <strong>choose a taxon that more than 2/3
            of the identifiers agree with</strong>. Sometimes this means
            choosing a higher level taxon that contains a number of
            disagreeing taxa (e.g. you think it's a kingsnake and I think
            it's rattlesnake, so iNat chooses suborder Serpentes which
            contains all snakes). The algorithm also slightly favors
            dissent, because we've found that dissenters are often
            correct.
          </p>
          <p class="ui">
            The community taxon is the taxon we use when sharing observations
            with data partners, linking observations of the same taxon on the
            site, updating your life list, etc. If for some reason you don't
            agree with the community taxon, you can reject it, which means
            that your ID is the one used for linking to other observations,
            updating life lists, etc. It also means your observation can only
            become research grade when the community agrees with <em>you</em>.
            If you don't like the whole idea of community taxa, you can opt
            out of them entirely by <a href="/users/edit" target="_blank">editing your settings</a>.

        a_project_allows_you_to_gather: |
          A collection project allows you to gather and visualize observations using the core iNaturalist
          search tools. This eliminates the need to manually add observations because everything
          that meets the parameters set by the project will be automatically included.

          An umbrella project can be used to compare statistics across two or more Collection or
          Traditional Projects. The other projects need to exist before you can add them to an
          umbrella project. You can include hundreds of projects under a single umbrella. Umbrella

        bioblitz_results_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Unlike regular projects, bioblitzes display event stats from
            <em>all</em> observations within a place and time period, not just
            observations that people have intentionally added to the project.
            This is to remove the hurdle of adding observations to a project
            just to drive the stats in real time. Note that observations won't
            be available for export or display on various project views such
            as member contributions on the website or project observation
            searches in the mobile apps unless the project team and
            participants actively add relevant observations like they would in
            a normal project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that while this kind of project shows stats for observations that
            haven't been deliberately added to the project, it does not allow
            curators to see private or obscured coordinates for those
            observations or assume that observers have agreed to the project
            terms. If you're a project curator and you need access to private
            coordinates, you need your participants to agree to the project
            terms, or you want observations counted towards the curated project checklist,
            make sure your participants join the project and add their
            observations like they would in a normal project.

          computed them again in the present, but they should still provide a
          decent measure for how fast the community is at identifying within 1
          week windows. Note that these stats are only for observations with

          correspond to our usual "iconic" taxon colors (green for plants,
          orange for insects, blue for most other animals, etc.), so if you're

        about_names_desc: |
          <p>
            Most categories of organisms have "common names" in spoken
            languages. These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,
            and stable over time, but many organisms have several different
            names in different places, even in the same language, which can make
            it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.
            Scientists address this problem by using a single "scientific name"
            for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature">biological nomenclature</a>,
            but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody
            speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many
            people. Scientific names can also reflect an organism's taxonomic
            placement, so they can change when scientists develop more
            accurate theories about the evolutionary relationships between
            different organisms, again reducing their usefulness in
            communication, even among people who know scientific names.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old adage sums it up: "Common names change from place to
            place, and scientific names change from time to time."
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to address these shortcomings by showing both common
            and scientific names wherever possible, and choosing common names
            based on the language and geographic preferences of the viewer.
          </p>
        about_conservation_status_desc: |
          The conservation status summarizes the risk of extinction for a group of organisms.
        about_establishment_desc: |
          "Establishment means" describes how a species arrived where it
          currently occurs. Introduced means it arrived because of human
          activity, while native means it arrived without human assistance.
          Endemic species only occur in a specific place and nowhere else.

          contact one of these people.
        charts_help_seasonality: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon grouped by
          month. Keep in mind that these are numbers of observations, so they
          are influenced both by when the organism can be observed and when
          people bother to observe them. So a bird might seem to be very active
          in May, but that could also be due to more people birding in May who
          tend to ignore that species in later months. Similarly, if you see
          more dragonflies in June than in January, that's probably because we
          have more people observing in the northern hemisphere than in the
          southern hemisphere and not because dragonflies are more active in
          June, so check the map when considering these charts. It's always a
          good idea to be skeptical of these charts when there are low numbers
          of observations and/or large discrepancies between the number of
          "Verifiable" and "Research Grade" observations.
        charts_help_history: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon by month for
          the last ten years. Again, it is biased by the number of people
          observing, but it will show you unusual spikes in observations, and if
          it seems flat or decreasing despite an increasing number of observers,
          that might suggest a change in abundance.
        charts_help_other: |
          We also show seasonality charts for observation annotations.
          Annotations are a new system for adding metadata to observations using
          a controlled vocabulary of terms. So far we are only using "Life
          Stage" and "Plant Phenology" (when the plant is flowering or
          fruiting). We do not yet have a way to add annotations directly, so
          for now we are converting data from observation fields to annotations.
          If you can't wait for us to build our annotating system, you can
          contribute to "Life Stage" annotations by adding observation field
          values that have any of the following values: Adult, Teneral, Pupa,
          Nymph, Larva, Egg, or Juvenile. So in particular, the "Life Stage" and
          "Insect Life Stage" fields are good. For "Plant Phenology," we're
          looking at any field with the word "phenology" in its name and
          "flower" or "fruit" in the value, so the "Flowering Phenology" field
          is a good one to use.
        charts_help_relative_observations: |
          Showing frequency as a relative proportion of all observations helps
          smooth out the effect of the overall growth of the site. For example,
          if the site is growing as we get more observations with every passing
          year, we get more observations of any individual taxon, which doesn't
          tell you anything about whether there are more of that taxon around to
          observe, just that there are more people observing it. Showing the
          relative proportion means that if there are 100 observations total but
          20 observations of this taxon, the proportion is 0.2 (20 / 100). If
          people observe 2000 observations the next year and 400 observations of
          this taxon, the proportion is still 0.2 (400 / 2000). This causes some
          abberrations when there are very few observers in an area, or for taxa
          that are very infrequently observed, but that's true of total counts
          as well.
        complete_taxon_desc: |
          "Complete" taxa have all of their descendant, extant taxa of a
          specific rank present in the site's database. When a taxon is
          complete to species, for example, we can say how many of its species
          have been observed and how many still need to be observed. Counts of
          species for "complete" taxa complete to species do not include
          "uncountable" species like extinct species or inactive species
          concepts, and they only include species, not infraspecific taxa like
          subspecies or varieties.

        Children of the input taxon that are genera or coarser will be moved to
        the output; species, subspecies, varieties, etc. will be swapped into
        equivalents with the new genus or species name.
      form:
        move_children_desc_html: |
          Checking this box will move the children of the input taxon to the
          output taxon for Swaps and Merges when this change is committed. If
          this change to a genus or lower, it will create Taxon Swaps for all
          descendants that have an implied name change. For example, if you swap
          the family Canidae into Dogidae, this change the parent of the genus
          <i>Canis</i> from Canidae to Dogidae. If you swap the genus
          <i>Canis</i> into the genus <i>Dogis</i>, it will create and commit
          Taxon Swaps to change <i>Canis lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> and
          <i>Canis lupus</i> ssp. <i>lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> ssp.
          <i>lupus</i>. This can cause quite a mess, so use with care.

        blocking_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Blocking someone prevents them from messaging you, commenting on your
            observations, identifying your observations, and otherwise interacting
            with you on %{site_name}. It also removes their observations from your
            search results and removes your observations from their search
            results. However, it does not make you invisible to them. They can
            still find your observations and view your profile, they just can't
            interact with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blocking is for situations where you just can't get along with
            someone and they won't leave you alone, despite your best efforts to
            settle disputes in a civilized manner. It is not a way to hide from
            people, to prevent identifications from people whose opinions you
            don't trust, or to opt out of the community ID (there's another
            setting for that). Thus, blocking works both ways: if you block
            someone, they can't interact with you, but you also can't interact
            with them. If you misuse it to prevent someone from identifying your
            observations, you also prevent yourself from identifying their
            observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only block three people. We think this is a reasonable
            number that accommodates the people who need blocking while
            preventing abuse of blocking. If you feel you need to block more
            people, please <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If someone is harassing or stalking you on %{site_name},

            this represents a violation of our Terms of Service or represents

          The <a href="%{url}" target="_blank">iNaturalist Network</a> is a
          collection of localized websites connected to the global iNaturalist
          community. You can change your primary site affiliation, which means
          that your content will have some priority on that site, but also
          means that the owners of that site have the right to download and
          view all your data just like the iNaturalist site admins can. If
          that site leaves the network, all your account and data will go with

          Licensing your content gives other people the legal right to use it
          without asking your permission if they stick to the terms of the
          license. %{site_name} uses your Creative Commons-licensed content to share
          with data partners like the <a href="http://www.gbif.org/">Global

          biodiversity information from around the world.
        muting_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Muting someone prevents you from receiving notifications about things
            they do, including commenting on your observations, messaging you,
            mentioning you, etc. Muting helps you ignore someone without
            preventing them from doing anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can mute as many people as you want, but keep in mind that
            you'll be missing out on potentially important notifications, like
            identifications that shift the Community ID on your observations.

          basis.
        taxon_change_desc: |
          When taxa are merged or renamed on %{site_name}, your observations, listed
          taxa, identifications, etc. will be automatically updated to the new
          taxa if the change is unambiguous. If you opt out or the change is
          ambiguous (e.g. a split), you will receive an update about the
          change linking to a tool you can use to manually update your content
          if you choose.
        prefers_community_taxa_desc: |
          %{site_name} tracks what you think your observations are and what
          the community thinks they are. The identification we share with data
          partners is the community identification, but if you don't think the
          community's opinion should ever overrule your own, you can opt out
          here. People will still be able to add identifications, but the
          community opinion won't be favored over yours. This means your
          observations will not be eligible for research grade unless you
          agree with the community.

                with them. You can still save a draft, and if you're still
                using the site in a day, you'll be able to publish.
