So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

  the_identotron_is_a_tool_to: |
     The Identotron is a tool to help you identify observations based on
     %{place}'s check list data.  Given a higher level taxon and a place (e.g.
     mammals of India), %{place} will look for check lists entries matching that
     taxon in that place, kind of like a dynamic field guide to the entire
     planet. Most %{place} check lists are works in progress, but if there's one
     that is comprehensive, i.e. it lists <em>all</em> the representatives of
     its taxon in a place, the Identotron will show a notice.

        you_can_contact_us_at_html: 'You can contact us at <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">%{help_email}</a>'
        what_are_admins_and_curators?: What are admins and curators?
        inat_admins_are_the_people_who: |
          %{site_name} admins are the people who run the site. They have direct access
          to the underlying code and the database, and they can change anything
          on the site.
        curators_are_inat_users_who_volunteer_to_html: |
          Curators are %{site_name} users who volunteer to help keep our taxonomic data
          up to date. If you're interested in becoming a curator, please 
          <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>. Curators can
          also promote other users to curator status. Please only promote people
          you trust and that you know to have some taxonomic knowledge.
        what_is_considered_inappropriate_content?: What is considered inappropriate content?
        you_know_it_when_you_see_it_html: | 
          You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">know it when you see it</a>, 
          right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
          is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
          the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
          probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
          animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
          interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
          that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
          nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth
          flagging and may be deleted, but evidence of pollution or disturbance
          could be interesting, and probably won't be removed.
        what_is_an_observation?: What is an observation?
        an_observation_is_the_what_where_and_when_html: |
          An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. 
          %{site_name} provides a place to add this information along with associated text, 
          photos, and tags. %{site_name} encourages the recording of all nature findings, 
          whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. 
          (In %{site_name} the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well 
          as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;)
        why_doesnt_inaturalist_recognize_the_name_ive_entered?: "Why doesn't %{site_name} recognize the name I've entered?"
        inaturalist_has_name_information_for_mammals:  |
          %{site_name} has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
          and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
          database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
          alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
          name to the tags or description fields.
        how_can_i_get_help_identifying_what_i_saw?: How can I get help identifying what I saw?
        check_the_id_please_checkbox_when_html: | 
          Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
          observation and your observation will appear in
          <a href="%{url}">ID Please</a>.
        what_does_it_mean_to_link_inaturalist_to_my_flickr_account?: What does it mean to link %{site_name} to my Flickr account?
        inaturalist_can_link_directly_to_the_flickr_photo_service: | 
          %{site_name} can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
          that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
          you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
          two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
          you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
          to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
        can_i_add_photos_without_a_flickr_account?: Can I add photos without a Flickr account?
        we_also_support_picasa_html:  'We also support Picasa: <a href="%{url}">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>'
        we_also_support_uploading_photos: |
                We also support uploading photos directly to %{site_name}, but it can be a bit
                slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Picasa is
                probably faster if you already use those services.
        what_are_tags?:  What are tags?
        tags_are_keywords_you_can_add_to_an_html: |
          Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. 
          For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, 
          you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.
        can_i_include_my_observations_on_my_blog?: Can I include my %{site_name} observations on my own website of blog?
        sure_check_out_our_widget_html: |
          Sure, check out our <a href="%{url}" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
        what_kind_of_photos_should_i_attach: What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?
        photos_attached_to_observations_should_be: | 
          Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
          at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
          tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
          observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
          different point in time.
        please_do_not_upload_pictures_you_didnt_take_html: | 
          Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
          obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
          copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
          of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
          photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
          someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
          it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
          observation's description.
        what_is_geoprivacy?: What is geoprivacy?
        geoprivacy_is_a_setting_you_can: |
          Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
          controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
          displayed. Here are the options:
        note_that_curators_of: | 
          Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
          coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
          concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
          you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
        what_is_does_it_mean_for: What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?
        when_coordinates_are_obscured_it_means_that: |
          When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
          %{km}KM of the true coordinates 
          is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
          project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
          are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
          pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
          the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
          true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
          circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
        coordinates_are_obscured_for_all_taxa: | 
          Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
          THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
          declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
          some may be simply marked as threatened by %{site_name} site curators if they
          believe it merits protection.
        you_can_also_obscure_the_coordinates_html: | 
          You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
          regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.
        what_is_the_quality_assessment: What is the quality assessment and how do observations qualify to become "research" grade?
        what_is_a_life_list?: What is a life list?
        just_a_simple_list: Just a simple list of taxa with no special behavior.
        automatically_updates_based_on_your_observations: |
          Automatically updates based on your observations. Everyone on %{site_name}
          has a default life list that contains every species that person has
          observed. If you delete an observation or change your ID, the
          species will get removed. You can also manually add taxa to your
          life list just like you can with an ordinary list. The species you
          add manually won't get removed if you observe them and then delete
          the observation.
        you_can_also_make_additional_life_lists: |
          You can also make additional life lists for specific groups of
          organisms, like a life list of birds, or a life list of milkweeds.
        a_project_list_belongs: |
          A project list belongs to a project and lists all the taxa
          observed by members of that project. Project lists can also be
          populated manually by the admin of that project, and can be used
          to restrict project contributions to taxa that are on the list.
        a_check_list_is_html: |
          A check list is a list of taxa that occur in a place. Every place
          has a default check list, and whenever an observation is made
          within the place's boundaries <em>and</em> it has achieved
          research-grade status, the species observed will get automatically
          added to the place's check list.
        inat_users_can_also: |
          %{site_name} users can also add additional check lists to places, but
          these check lists are not automatically updated. They mainly
          provide a way for people to bring in outside sources of data or
          just list things based on their own experience.
        is_a_list_of_every_species_that_you_have_seen: |
          A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every %{site_name} user has a life 
          list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to %{site_name}.
        i_observed_a_species: "I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?"
        while_the_life_list_is_automatically_populated: |
                While the life list is automatically populated from added
                observations, the species will not be added to this list if
                %{site_name} does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
                trying alternative names that we might recognize.
    observations:
      copy_tip: "Add a new observation by copying this observation's date, place, photos, and observaiton fields."
      captive_help_html: |
        Was the organism <strong>cultivated</strong> or
        <strong>captive</strong>? For example, was it in a <strong>garden,
        zoo, aquarium</strong> or some other situation in which it was
        only present <strong>because human beings intended it to be there</strong>? All
        observations of living things are welcome, but we'd like to know
        when things are not wild / naturalized.

        invite_your_friends_description: |
          You can make it super easy for people on Facebook and Flickr to add their 
          photos as %{site_name} observations. Just leave a comment including this 
          special invite URL below. You can also pre-select a taxon and project for 
          the new observation.

        taxon_change_desc: |
          Taxon changes represent changes to %{site_name}'s taxonomy.
          Most of the time %{site_name} will automatically keep
          your content up-to-date when these changes happen (unless you've
          opted-out), but we still want to let you know when and how your data
          is changing.
        your_content_will_be_updated: Your content related to these taxa will be updated automatically.
        you_may_want_to_update: You have some content related to these taxa that you may want to update.
        cannot_update_your_content: "%{site_name} cannot update your content automatically for this change."
        new_project_admin_html: |
          Wondering why you're now admin for this project? The previous owner
          probably deleted their account, so %{site_name} assigned you because
          you're a project manager or a site curator. If you don't want to be
          the project admin, please contact 
          <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">%{help_email}</a>
        curators_can_see: |
          Just a reminder, project curators can see the private and obscured
          coordinates of observations you add to this project.
      edit:
        taxon_change_desc: |
          When taxa are merged or renamed on %{site_name}, your observations, listed
          taxa, identifications, etc. will be automatically updated to the new
          taxa if the change is unambiguous. If you opt out or the change is
          ambiguous (e.g. a split), you will receive an update about the
          change linking to a tool you can use to manually update your content
          if you choose.
