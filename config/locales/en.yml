    <h4>
      Trips enable the collection of presence-absence data by adding context to
      your observations
    </h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Why</strong> Presence-absence data include information about
      sampling effort which is useful for scientific analyses like distribution
      modeling (raw iNaturalist observations are 'presence-only' data).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How</strong> A trip adds context to your observations by recording:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What</strong> you searched for (target list)</li>
      <li><strong>Where</strong> you searched (search area)</li>
      <li><strong>When</strong> you searched (search interval)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Species on your target list that you were able to observe within the
      search area and interval are interpreted as presences. While species on
      your target list that you were unable to observe are interpreted as
      absences. Click 'Tabulate Presence Absence Data From Trips' to generate a
      table of presence-absence records for a species from trips and associated
      observations. <a href='%{url}'>Learn more</a>

    This includes observations where you have set the geoprivacy to "obscured"

  about_trusting_projects_options_taxon: |-

  about_trusting_projects_options_taxon_desc: |-
    Many projects just need access to coordinates that are obscured because the

  about_trusting_projects_overview: |-
    Granting access to your hidden coordinates will allow the managers of this
    project to see the true, unobscured location of your observations in this
    project. This is extremely important in situations where scientists or
    resource managers need access to exact coordinates for analysis and
    decision-making.

    Note that project managers can change the project parameters to include any
    of your observations, and they can add or remove project managers at any
    time. You will receive notifications about these changes, but you are

    You must provide a more detailed explanation of what you want to build.
  app_owner_application_about_p1a_html: |
    iNaturalist apps allow authenticated use of the iNaturalist API. This
    allows you to make API calls that do things like create observations or
    identifications. Usual use cases are apps such as desktop apps or mobile
    apps that include functionality for their user(s) to create iNaturalist
    observations. This content must be generated with real human involvement
    or oversight. Please read our <a href="/pages/community+guidelines"
    target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a> prohibiting machine-generated
    observations, identifications, and comments for more details.
  app_owner_application_about_p2_html: |
    As of 2022 we are requiring manual approval for users wishing to make API clients.
    In order to create third-party apps, you must first submit an application to become
    an "app owner." This application should describe the functionality of your proposed app
    and how you plan to use it. In order to submit an application your account must be at
    least 2 months old and must have made at least 10 <a href="/pages/help#identification"
    target="_blank">improving identifications</a> in the last month. We may ask follow-up
    questions about your plan and we reserve the right to turn down applications for any reason.
  app_owner_application_inelligible: |

    integral to iNaturalist, as they keep our taxonomy up-to-date and the
    discourse on iNaturalist appropriate and civil. Below is a description
    of what being a curator means. Please read it and, if you would like to

  heads_up_automatable_draft_split_notice_html: |
    <strong>Heads up:</strong> When you commit this change, identifications will
    be re-assigned to the output taxa based on their atlases. If some or all of
    the outputs lack atlases, or if atlases overlap for a given record,
    identifications will be replaced with identifications of the nearest common
    ancestor taxon (%{taxon})
  heads_up_non_automatable_draft_split_notice_html: |
    <strong>Heads up:</strong> This taxon split has output taxa that either do
    not have atlases or don't share a common ancestor, so the records
    associated with its input taxa cannot be automatically assigned to output
    taxa when this split is committed and the community will have to add new
    IDs for these records.
  heads_up_automatable_split_notice_html: |
    <strong>Heads up:</strong> Some or all of the identifications affected by
    this split may have been replaced with identifications of %{taxon}. This
    happens when we can't automatically assign an identification to one of the
    output taxa.
  heads_up_observose_taxon_change_html: |

  locked_taxa_will_not_allow_new: Locked taxa will not allow new descendent taxa to be added to them. So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

    <p>
      We store personal information like usernames and email addresses in
      order to manage accounts on this site, and to comply with privacy laws,
      we need you to check this box to indicate that you consent to this use
      of personal information. To learn more about what information we

  data_transfer_consent_desc_title: About Personal Information Transfer Consent
  data_transfer_consent_desc_html: |
    <p>
      Some data privacy laws, like the European Union's General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR), require explicit consent to transfer
      personal information from their jurisdictions to other jurisdictions
      where the legal protection of this information is not considered
      adequate. As of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Schrems#Schrems_II">2020</a>,
      the European Union no longer considers the United States to be a
      jurisdiction that provides adequate legal protection of personal
      information, specifically because of the possibility of the US government
      surveilling data entering the US. It is possible other jurisdictions
      may have the same opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using iNaturalist requires the storage of personal information like your
      email address, all iNaturalist data is stored in the United States, and
      we cannot be sure what legal jurisdiction you are in when you are using
      iNaturalist, so in order to comply with privacy laws like the GDPR, you
      must acknowledge that you understand and accept this risk and consent
      to transferring your personal information to iNaturalist's servers in
      the US.
    </p>
    <p>

  places_warning_export_complex_boundary_html: |
    If you're trying to export observations from a complex boundary, consider
    <a href="https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7">downloading them from GBIF instead</a>,
    where you can draw arbitrary boundaries, or export them from iNat using
    existing places or a bounding box and then filter the data again once you've
    downloaded it.
  places_warning_look_for_existing2_html: |
    Look for <a href="/search?source[]=places">existing places</a> to make sure
    you're not creating a duplicate. We already have places for all the
    continents and countries, and many other political boundaries.
  places_warning_please_keep_in_mind: |
    Please keep in mind the following restrictions:
  places_warning_projects_can_have_multiple_places: |
    If you're trying to make a place for a project boundary, projects can be
    composed of multiple places. For example, if you want to make a project for
    New Zealand and Australia, you can just add requirements for two places
    instead of making a new one.
  places_warning_new_places_are_slow_html: |
    New places are one of the biggest sources of slowdowns on iNat, so
    <strong>please consider not making a new place</strong>. While small places
    containing only a few thousand observations are usually ok, if you make a
    new place that contains a lot of observations, you're going to slow iNat
    down for everyone else. Here are some alternative approaches:
  places_warning_editing_places_is_slow: |
    Editing place boundaries is one of the biggest sources of slowdowns on iNat.
    If you can avoid it, do not add, change, or remove place boundaries unless
    it's absolutely necessary.
  places_warning_quota: |
    You can only create three places per day.
  places_warning_the_future: |
    For what it's worth, we will have to restrict the conditions under which
    people can add places in the future given iNat's current rate of growth.

  sites_affiliation_examples_canada_cdc_html: |
    %{start_tag_inat_canada}iNaturalist Canada%{end_tag_inat_canada} enables
    data from iNaturalist to be incorporated into secure, provincial-level
    systems managed by Conservation Data Centers (CDCs). These systems are
    used when assessments are carried out (twice per year) to determine the
    at-risk status of species, as well as in determining the critical habitat of
    threatened and endangered species.   As a result, it has also been
    possible to locate and mitigate hotspots of road mortality for species at
    risk; delineate and eventually protect Key Biodiversity Areas, and;
    reconfirm the presence of species that had not been reported for decades.

    Information System (at CONABIO, the National Biodiversity Commision)
    together with records from eBird. People can find both scientific and
    citizen science records in
    %{start_tag_enciclovida}Enciclovida%{end_tag_enciclovida}.
  sites_affiliation_examples_portugal_atlas_html: |
    Portugal's iNaturalist network member
    %{start_tag_portugal}BioDiversity4All%{end_tag_portugal} shared records
    data for the Portuguese atlas of migratory birds, for the atlas of mammals,
    as well as several other Portuguese scientific research papers.
  sites_affiliation_more_automatically_hidden_coordinates: |
    Automatically hidden coordinates (obscured or private due to "taxon
    geoprivacy")
  sites_affiliation_more_automatically_hidden_coordinates_desc: |
    iNaturalist automatically hides the coordinates for some species to protect
    them from disturbance, collection, or poaching. If the observation
    coordinates have only been hidden automatically to protect species,
    iNaturalist shares the true coordinates of all observations from their
    respective countries with Network Members.
  sites_affiliation_more_email_addresses: |
    Email addresses are shared with Network Members solely for the purposes of
    communications related to the site.
  sites_affiliation_more_twice_per_year: |
    Twice per year, iNaturalist shares email addresses of affiliated accounts
    and some hidden coordinates (i.e. coordinates publicly obscured or private)
    with the iNaturalist Network Members to facilitate the use of iNaturalist
    data for research, conservation, and management in their respective
    areas. The two ways that coordinates can be hidden are shared
    differently, as described below.
  sites_affiliation_more_user_hidden_coordinates: |
    User-hidden coordinates (obscured or private due to "geoprivacy" setting)
  sites_affiliation_more_user_hidden_coordinates_desc: |
    Observations with hidden coordinates due to individual user's choices are
    shared in a much more limited and specific way.  By affiliating with a
    Network site, iNaturalist will share with that site’s administrators the
    precise coordinates of observations with geoprivacy that you have set to
    obscured or private, in addition to those which are publicly obscured or
    private due to taxon geoprivacy. This allows your observations to become
    more valuable to local conservation efforts.
  sites_affiliation_overview_current_member_list_html: |
    You can see the current member list for the
    %{start_tag_network}iNaturalist Network%{end_tag_network}.
  sites_affiliation_overview_in_order_to_advance: |
    In order to advance research and conservation in their respective areas,
    Network Members may share data from iNaturalist. They have a responsibility
    to assess the validity and appropriateness of data requests and their
    potential outcomes; convey in writing the responsibility to also ensure the
    security of such data and not to expose it publicly in any way, or share or
    use it beyond its original intended purpose; to document all instances of
    sharing along with the associated results, outcomes, or intended uses; and
    to report annually to iNaturalist.
  sites_affiliation_overview_the_inaturalist_network_is_a_collection_html: |
    The %{start_tag_network}iNaturalist Network%{end_tag_network} is a
    collection of localized websites in the %{start_tag_global}global
    iNaturalist community%{end_tag_global}.
  sites_affiliation_overview_when_you_affiliate: |
    When you affiliate with an iNaturalist Network Member, your email address
    and the true locations of your obscured and private locations are shared
    with the Network Member. This allows your observations to become more
    valuable to local conservation efforts. If you live in or frequently visit
    an area that is a member of the Network, you are encouraged to choose
    that as your affiliation to facilitate data sharing.
  sites_affiliation_overview_you_can_continue_html: |
    You can continue to log in through iNaturalist.org or through your
    network-specific website. No matter your affiliation, all your data will be
    hosted in the same place and you’ll continue to be able to interact with
    the broader international iNaturalist community. Each iNaturalist account
    can be affiliated with only one Network Member. You may review or change
    your affiliation in your
    %{start_tag_settings}account settings%{end_tag_settings}.

  sites_network_inaturalist_network_collection: |
    The iNaturalist Network is a collection of localized websites that are fully
    connected to the global iNaturalist community. Network sites are supported
    by local institutions that promote local use and facilitate the use of data
    from iNaturalist to benefit local biodiversity. They have access to true
    coordinates within their geographic areas that are automatically obscured from
    public view in order to better protect threatened species.
  sites_network_your_username: |
    Your username and password work on all sites that are part of the
    iNaturalist Network. If you choose to affiliate with a Network site, the
    local institutions that support each site will also have access to your

        geomodel_predictions_of_taxon: |
          Geomodel Predictions of %{taxon}
        the_geo_model_makes_predictions: |
          The Geomodel makes predictions about where species occur and where they are absent.
          We use the Geomodel to apply the "Expected Nearby" label alongside suggestions and
          to weight these suggestions based on the location of the observation.
        the_geo_model_is_trained: |
          Like the Computer Vision Model, the Geomodel is trained on iNaturalist observations
          for the same set of species with roughly more than 100 photos. The Geomodel does not
          make perfect predictions. You can read more about how the Geomodel is made
          <a href="%{url}">here</a>.
        nearby_map:
          expected_nearby_map: Expected Nearby Map
          we_use_this_map: |
            We use this map to apply the Expected Nearby label to suggestions based on the
            location of the observation.
          for_example: |
            For example, an observation of a lizard in the center of the United States might
            have the Expected Nearby label applied to a suggestion of <i>Sceloporus consobrinus</i>
            but not <i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i> based on their respective Expected Nearby Maps.
          you_can_think: |
            You can think of the Expected Nearby Map as an estimate of whether the species
            is present somewhere inside the grid cell or entirely absent.
          figure_alt_text: The Geomodel applies the Expected Nearby label
        unthresholded_map:
          unthresholded_map: Unthresholded Map
          we_use_the_unthresholded_map: |
            We use the Unthresholded Map to weight computer vision scores by location when
            offering suggestions.
          for_example: |
            For example, an observation of a lizard in the center of the United States might
            have the suggestions of <i>Sceloporus consobrinus</i> weighted more than suggestions
            of <i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i> based on comparing the Unthresholded Maps, despite
            being visually similar.
          you_can_think: |
            You can think of the Unthresholded Map as the relative probability that a species
            occurs within a grid cell.
          figure_alt_text: The Geomodel weights Computer Vision results
        range_comparison:
          expected_nearby_vs_taxon_range: Expected Nearby vs Taxon Range
          this_map_shows: |
            This map shows the Taxon Range for this species overlapping the Expected Nearby Map
            that we use to evaluate the Geomodel.
          this_gridded_version: |
            This gridded version of the Taxon Range is a snapshot taken when the model was
            trained and gridded at the same resolution as the Expected Nearby Map. We only
            use the Taxon Ranges where at least 90% of the training data for that species
            falls within the Taxon Range to control for errors in the Taxon Ranges.
          by_combining: |
            By combining the Expected Nearby Map to the Taxon Range, we calculate statistics
            to estimate how well the Geomodel performs.
          figure_alt_text: The Expected Nearby map and Taxon Range are compared
          combining_these_maps_produces: |
            Combining these maps produces 3 types of cells:

          true_presences_colon: |

          # Nearby Map that are True Presences) and Recall (fraction of the
          # Taxon Range that are True Presences)
          f1_colon: |

          f1_description: The average (harmonic mean) of Precision and Recall
          # Equation showing how we calculate the F1 statstitic of the Expected Nearby Map
          # True Presences: areas where both the Expected Nearby Map and the Taxon Range predict that the taxon exists
          # False Presences: areas where only the Expected Nearby Map predicts the taxon exists
          # False Absences: areas where only the Taxon Range is present
          f1_equation: |
            2 × True Presences / (2 × True Presences + False Presences + False Absences) = %{f1}
          perfect_overlap: |
            Perfect overlap would evaluate with a Precision, Recall and F1 of 1. No overlap
            would evaluate with a Precision , Recall, and F1 of 0.

          Guides help you learn about biodiversity all around the world.
          Whether you're exploring the Serengeti or just your local park
          (which might be the Serengeti), Guides can help you make sense of
          our planet's stunning diversity of life.

        add_eol_content: |
          Add EOL content to selected taxa as a batch. This can take some
          time, so please be patient.
        add_color_tags_help: |
          Add color tags from colors associated with the selected taxa.
        add_rank_tags_help_html: |
          Add taxon rank tags based on our taxonomy, e.g.
          <code>family=Laridae</code>
          or
          <code>family=Gulls and Allies</code>
        coordinates_desc: |
          Giving your guide coordinates will help people find it when searching by location.
        eol_subjects_desc: |
          EOL publishes content under a number of different subject headings,
          not all of which are available for every taxon. Choosing "Overview"
          will just import the first available text section from EOL, which
          generally contains a summary when available.
        eol_collection_desc_html: |
          The <a href="http://eol.org/" target="_blank">Encyclopedia of Life (EOL)</a>
          is a repository of information about life on Earth. At EOL you can
          create
          <a href="http://eol.org/info/252" target="_blank">collections</a>
          of species. If you want to import species from an EOL collection,
          paste in the URL of that collection here.
        guide_place_desc: |
          Associating your guide with a place will let people find it when
          searching for places, and it will show the place boundary on
          %{site_name} maps where they are shown if a boundary has been set
          (e.g. "card" view, taxon pages, etc.)
        import_tags_from_csv_help_html: |
          <p>
            Upload a CSV file containing tags for taxa in this guide. Your CSV file should look like this:
          </p>
          <table class="table">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>color</th>
                <th>Number of hands</th>
                <th></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Homo sapiens</td>
                <td></td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>bipedal</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Vulpes vulpes</td>
                <td>red|black</td>
                <td>0</td>
                <td>quadripedal</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            The first row starts with "Name" followed by the tag
            predicates/categories. Then each following row starts with the
            name of taxon, followed by tags corresponding predicate the top
            of the column. In this example, <i>Homo sapiens</i> gets the
            tags <code>bipedal</code> and <code>Number of hands=2</code>,
            and <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> gets <code>quadripedal</code>,
            <code>color=red</code>, <code>color=black</code>, and
            <code>Number of hands=0</code>. Blanks will be ignored, and you
            can add multiple lines per taxon. You can also add multiple
            values per cell separated by the pipe character.

        licensing_explanation: |
          Licensing your content grants other people the right to copy and
          modify it without asking your permission. It makes it much easier to
          share your work, and if you incorporate 3rd party content from other
          sources that use Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses (like
          Wikipedia), you are legally obliged to use a similar license. Here's
          an overview of all the Creative Commons licenses and what they mean:
        paste_note_html: |
          Paste in up to 500 species names, one per line. %{site_name} will do
          its best to match common names to species concepts, but to avoid
          ambiguity it's better to use scientific names. If you want to
          specify them both, separate the scientific name from the common name
          with a comma, like <code>Homo sapiens,Human</code>.
        places_note: |
          Note: not all places have check lists with taxa. If you're having
          trouble finding a place with taxa, try choosing larger areas with
          political boundaries, like nations, states, provinces, or counties.
        replace_existing_eol_desc: Delete existing content before importing from EOL
        place_choose_taxon_note: |
          Choose a taxon to filter by if you want to narrow your search, e.g. "plants"

            If for some reason a user doesn't agree with the community taxon,
            they can reject it, which means their ID is the one used for
            linking to other observations, updating life lists, etc. It also
            means their observation can only become research grade when the
            community agrees with them.

          Genus Homo, both taxa will be present in the table, but that
          represents one additional  row for Genus Homo for Query 1, which
          didn't include it in its total count because it only counted the
          species Homo sapiens within that genus, because that was the "leaf" of

          <h3>Other Options</h3>
          <p>
            Large exports slow down our infrastructure and make it harder for us
            to release new changes. Here are some other options to consider:

                GBIF ingests most of our Research Grade, licensed observations,
                and their export tools are excellent. GBIF exports also come
                with a <a href="https://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> you can cite if
                you publish research based on the data you export, and these
                citations are enormously helpful to us as they allow us to see
                how iNat data gets used.

          In February 2019, Google changed their API, making it impossible for
          us to access GPS coordinates, license information, and almost any
          information we could use to add an identification (like tags). They
          also removed text search and numerical pagination. On top of that,
          they required all connected accounts to have an additional permission,
          and before a third party can request that permission from users, the
          third party has to be verified. We are awaiting verification, but
          until that happens, you will not be able to import photos from Google.
          If we get approved, you will be able to import photos, but they won't
          include any location information or license information that you might
          be able to see on Google Photos. You can read more about this at <a

            The community taxon (or community identification) represents
            what taxon the %{site_name} community thinks is depicted in an
            observation. If you're interested in how we choose the
            community taxon, see the notes on the algorithm below, but in
            general, we try to <strong>choose a taxon that more than 2/3
            of the identifiers agree with</strong>. Sometimes this means
            choosing a higher level taxon that contains a number of
            disagreeing taxa (e.g. you think it's a kingsnake and I think
            it's rattlesnake, so iNat chooses suborder Serpentes which
            contains all snakes). The algorithm also slightly favors
            dissent, because we've found that dissenters are often
            correct.

          <p class="ui">
            A research grade observation must have (among other criteria) a
            community taxon. If an observation has
            only one identification, it won’t have a community taxon. All
            observations with at least one identification will also have an
            observation taxon. The observation taxon is the taxon we use when
            sharing observations with data partners, linking observations of
            the same taxon on the site, updating your life list, etc. In most
            cases the observation taxon will eventually be set to the community
            taxon, but sometimes they will differ especially before the community
            has settled on an identification. For example, if you think
            its a snake (suborder Serpentes) and I think it’s a kingsnake (genus
            <i>Lampropeltis</i>) the observation taxon will be at kingsnake (supported
            by my identification only) but the community taxon will be at
            serpentes (supported by at least two identifications). If for
            some reason you don't agree with the community taxon, you can
            reject it on your own observations, which means that observation
            taxon will never be set to the community taxon (rather your own ID).
            It also means your observation can only become research grade when the community
            agrees with <em>you</em>. If you don't like the whole idea of
            community taxa, you can opt out of them entirely by

            IDs, ‘disagreements’ - the number of IDs that are completely different (i.e. IDs of taxa
            that do not contain the taxon being scored), and ‘ancestor disagreements’ - the number of
            more conservative IDs that disagree with the finer taxon. For the identified taxa that
            have a score over 2/3 and at least 2 identifications, choose the lowest ranked taxon.

        bioblitz_results_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Unlike regular projects, bioblitzes display event stats from
            <em>all</em> observations within a place and time period, not just
            observations that people have intentionally added to the project.
            This is to remove the hurdle of adding observations to a project
            just to drive the stats in real time. Note that observations won't
            be available for export or display on various project views such
            as member contributions on the website or project observation
            searches in the mobile apps unless the project team and
            participants actively add relevant observations like they would in
            a normal project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that while this kind of project shows stats for observations that
            haven't been deliberately added to the project, it does not allow
            curators to see private or obscured coordinates for those
            observations or assume that observers have agreed to the project
            terms. If you're a project curator and you need access to private
            coordinates, you need your participants to agree to the project
            terms, or you want observations counted towards the curated project checklist,
            make sure your participants join the project and add their
            observations like they would in a normal project.

        growth_by_country_desc_html: |
          Where is growth happening? This map and chart attempt to break this
          down by country, which turns out to be complicated because growth by
          country can be very imbalanced. Here we've chosen to omit the United
          States and use a log scale by default to accentuate differences
          between other countries. If a country is colored black that means it
          did not contribute signicantly to a percentage, or it had no growth
          this year, or did not have more observations this year than last year
          (hover over a country to see a little more detail). <strong>"% of
          total growth"</strong> means how much of worldwide growth came from a
          particular country, e.g. if there were 20 observations in 2018 and 10
          in 2017, that would be 10 observations of growth, and if 5 of those
          observations were from Benin, then Benin contributed 50% of total
          growth. <strong>"% growth"</strong> means the number of observations
          this year in that country as a percent of observations last year in
          that country, so if there were 10 observations in Laos last year but
          20 this year, that would be 100% growth, and if there were 0 last year
          and 1 this year, that's infinity % growth.

        about_names_desc: |
          <p>
            Most categories of organisms have "common names" in spoken
            languages. These names are usually recognizable, easy to pronounce,
            and stable over time, but many organisms have several different
            names in different places, even in the same language, which can make
            it difficult to communicate about these organisms without confusion.
            Scientists address this problem by using a single "scientific name"
            for each category of organism that conforms to the rules of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature">biological nomenclature</a>,
            but these names tend to be based on Latin, a language nobody
            speaks, so they are not as memorable as common names for many
            people. Scientific names can also reflect an organism's taxonomic
            placement, so they can change when scientists develop more
            accurate theories about the evolutionary relationships between
            different organisms, again reducing their usefulness in
            communication, even among people who know scientific names.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old adage sums it up: "Common names change from place to
            place, and scientific names change from time to time."
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to address these shortcomings by showing both common
            and scientific names wherever possible, and choosing common names
            based on the language and geographic preferences of the viewer.
            Names are listed by their global priority within each Language /
            Type.
          </p>
        about_regional_names_desc: |
          <p>
            Names may be added to places (usually countries) in cases where
            different countries or regions use different common names in the
            same language. For example, Mexico and Costa Rica may have different
            Spanish names for the same species.
          </p>
          <p>
            This table shows which names have been added to which places, and
            are listed in order of priority for each place. If two Spanish names
            are added to Mexico, the one listed first will appear if you prefer
            to see Spanish names added to Mexico.

        about_conservation_status_desc: |
          The conservation status summarizes the risk of extinction for a group of organisms.
        about_establishment_desc: |
          "Establishment means" describes how a species arrived where it
          currently occurs. Introduced means it arrived because of human
          activity, while native means it arrived without human assistance.
          Endemic species only occur in a specific place and nowhere else.
        about_taxon_curators_desc: |

          this taxon. If you want to make changes, please flag this taxon or
          contact one of these people.
        charts_help_seasonality: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon grouped by
          month. Keep in mind that these are numbers of observations, so they
          are influenced both by when the organism can be observed and when
          people bother to observe them. So a bird might seem to be very active
          in May, but that could also be due to more people birding in May who
          tend to ignore that species in later months. Similarly, if you see
          more dragonflies in June than in January, that's probably because we
          have more people observing in the northern hemisphere than in the
          southern hemisphere and not because dragonflies are more active in
          June, so check the map when considering these charts. It's always a
          good idea to be skeptical of these charts when there are low numbers
          of observations and/or large discrepancies between the number of
          "Verifiable" and "Research Grade" observations.
        charts_help_history: |
          This chart shows the number of observations of this taxon by month for
          the last ten years. Again, it is biased by the number of people
          observing, but it will show you unusual spikes in observations, and if
          it seems flat or decreasing despite an increasing number of observers,
          that might suggest a change in abundance.
        charts_help_other: |
          We also show seasonality charts for observation annotations.
          Annotations are a way to add metadata to observations using
          a controlled vocabulary of terms, e.g. whether an observation depicts
          a plant that is flowering or fruiting.
        charts_help_relative_observations: |
          Showing frequency as a relative proportion of all observations helps
          smooth out the effect of the overall growth of the site. For example,
          if the site is growing as we get more observations with every passing
          year, we get more observations of any individual taxon, which doesn't
          tell you anything about whether there are more of that taxon around to
          observe, just that there are more people observing it. Showing the
          relative proportion means that if there are 100 observations total but
          20 observations of this taxon, the proportion is 0.2 (20 / 100). If
          people observe 2000 observations the next year and 400 observations of
          this taxon, the proportion is still 0.2 (400 / 2000). This causes some
          aberrations when there are very few observers in an area, or for taxa
          that are very infrequently observed, but that's true of total counts
          as well.
        complete_taxon_desc: |
          "Complete" taxa have all of their descendant, extant taxa of a
          specific rank present in the site's database. When a taxon is
          complete to species, for example, we can say how many of its species
          have been observed and how many still need to be observed. Counts of
          species for "complete" taxa complete to species do not include
          "uncountable" species like extinct species or inactive species
          concepts, and they only include species, not infraspecific taxa like
          subspecies or varieties.

          Checking this box will move the children of the input taxon to the

          this is a change to a genus or lower, it will create Taxon Swaps for all
          descendants with names that need to change. For example, if you swap
          the family Canidae into Dogidae, this will change the parent of the genus
          <i>Canis</i> from Canidae to Dogidae. If you swap the genus
          <i>Canis</i> into the genus <i>Dogis</i>, it will create and commit
          Taxon Swaps to change <i>Canis lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> and
          <i>Canis lupus</i> ssp. <i>lupus</i> to <i>Dogis lupus</i> ssp.

        blocking_desc_html: |
          <p>
            Blocking someone prevents them from messaging you, commenting on your
            observations, identifying your observations, and otherwise interacting
            with you on %{site_name}. It also removes their observations from your
            search results and removes your observations from their search
            results. However, it does not make you invisible to them. They can
            still find your observations and view your profile, they just can't
            interact with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blocking is for situations where you just can't get along with
            someone and they won't leave you alone, despite your best efforts to
            settle disputes in a civilized manner. It is not a way to hide from
            people, to prevent identifications from people whose opinions you
            don't trust, or to opt out of the community ID (there's another
            setting for that). Thus, blocking works both ways: if you block
            someone, they can't interact with you, but you also can't interact
            with them. If you misuse it to prevent someone from identifying your
            observations, you also prevent yourself from identifying their
            observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can only block three people. We think this is a reasonable
            number that accommodates the people who need blocking while
            preventing abuse of blocking. If you feel you need to block more
            people, please <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>.

          <p>
            Muting someone prevents you from receiving notifications about things
            they do, including commenting on your observations, messaging you,
            mentioning you, etc. Muting helps you ignore someone without

          %{site_name} tracks what you think your observations are and what the
          community thinks they are. If you don't think the community's opinion
          should overrule your own, you can opt out here. People will still be
          able to add identifications, but your observations will remain
          associated with the taxon from your identification. This means your
          observations will not be eligible for Research Grade status unless
          your identification matches the community's opinion.
        prefers_coordinate_interpolation_protection_desc: |
          When you set the geoprivacy of an observation to "obscured" or
          "private" this will apply the same geoprivacy to all your other
          observations from the same day to make it harder for other people to
          guess the true coordinates based on observations made around the same
          time.

          <strong>These third-party services provide enormous value to
          us</strong> in maintaining the stability and usability of iNaturalist
          with our relatively small staff. On mobile devices, there is almost no
          other way we can gain insight into problems that are occurring, since
          the software is running on devices we do not control. Sometimes we
          aren’t even aware such problems are occurring until we see them in the
          data these services provide. <strong>By sharing this information, you
          are helping us serve you and the entire iNaturalist
          community.</strong>
        prefers_no_tracking_label_desc_limits: |
          Note that this option only applies to analytics and crash data that we
          are explicitly sending to these companies. All iNaturalist servers are
          provided and hosted by Microsoft, all iNaturalist images are hosted by
          Amazon, and almost all iNaturalist maps are served by Google, which
          means every time you look at an observation on iNaturalist, you are
          connecting to services provided by these companies and exposing your
          IP address to them, at the very least (in the iPhone app we use
          Apple’s maps). iNaturalist probably would not exist without the
          services these companies provide, and while we can limit the amount
          and kinds of data you share with them while using iNat, we cannot stop
          the flow of data entirely.

            We want to welcome new users, but we also want to combat
            spammers. Hopefully this tool will help with both. We are
            automatically flagging many users as spammers using <a
            href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, but Akismet isn't perfect,
            so if you want to put in a few minutes marking new accounts as
            spammers or not spammers, it would help.

            Thanks for being an iNaturalist donor! We were able to use your
            existing donation to confirm your identity, and don't need any
            further action from you. <strong>Your child's account has been
            activated.</strong>

        step1_title: CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR YOUR CHILD
        step1_desc: |
          In order to comply with privacy regulations, we need a parent or legal
          guardian's consent to create an account for a person under the age of
          13. If you would like your child to use iNaturalist, you must provide
          us with some identity and contact information.
        step2_title: CONFIRM YOUR IDENTITY WITH A CREDIT CARD
        step2_desc: |
          To confirm your identity as an adult, we need you to provide a nominal
          donation of at least US$1 to iNaturalist using a credit card. This is
          the least intrusive form of identity verification that allows us to
          comply with privacy laws. Please be sure to use the same email
          address you entered as the "parent email" in the previous step.
        step3_title: WAIT FOR THE CONFIRMATION EMAIL
        step3_desc: |
          Once we match the email used in the donation to the email you entered
          as the "parent email" we will activate the child's account and send
          the parent an email with login instructions. This can take up to 24
          hours.
        step3_donor_title: YOUR CHILD'S ACCOUNT HAS BEEN ACTIVATED
