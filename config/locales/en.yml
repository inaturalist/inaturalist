  locked_taxa_will_not_allow_new: Locked taxa will not allow new descendent taxa to be added to them. So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

     mammals of India), %{place} will look for check lists entries matching that
     taxon in that place, kind of like a dynamic field guide to the entire
     planet. Most %{place} check lists are works in progress, but if there's one
     that is comprehensive, i.e. it lists <em>all</em> the representatives of
     its taxon in a place, the Identotron will show a notice.

          Guides help you learn about biodiversity all around the world.
          Whether you're exploring the Serengeti or just your local park
          (which might be the Serengeti), Guides can help you make sense of
          our planet's stunning diversity of life.

        import_tags_from_csv_help_html: |
          <p>
            Upload a CSV file containing tags for taxa in this guide. Your CSV file should look like this:

                <th>color</th>
                <th>Number of hands</th>
                <th></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Homo sapiens</td>
                <td></td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            The first row starts with "Name" followed by the tag
            predicates/categories. Then each following row starts with the
            name of taxon, followed by tags corresponding predicate the top
            of the column. In this example, <i>Homo sapiens</i> gets the
            tags <code>bipedal</code> and <code>Number of hands=2</code>,
            and <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> gets <code>quadripedal</code>,
            <code>color=red</code>, <code>color=black</code>, and
            <code>Number of hands=0</code>. Blanks will be ignored, and you
            can add multiple lines per taxon. You can also add multiple
            values per cell separated by the pipe character.

        paste_note_html: |
          Paste in up to 500 species names, one per line. %{site_name} will do
          its best to match common names to species concepts, but to avoid
          ambiguity it's better to use scientific names. If you want to
          specify them both, separate the scientific name from the common name
          with a comma, like <code>Homo sapiens,Human</code>.
        places_note: |
          Note: not all places have check lists with taxa. If you're having
          trouble finding a place with taxa, try choosing larger areas with
          political boundaries, like nations, states, provinces, or counties.
        replace_existing_eol_desc: Delete existing content before importing from EOL
        place_choose_taxon_note: |
          Choose a taxon to filter by if you want to narrow your search, e.g. "plants"

          right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
          is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
          the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
          probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
          animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
          interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
          that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
          nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth

        what_is_an_observation?: What is an observation?
        an_observation_is_the_what_where_and_when_html: |
          An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. 
          %{site_name} provides a place to add this information along with associated text, 
          photos, and tags. %{site_name} encourages the recording of all nature findings, 
          whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. 
          (In %{site_name} the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well 
          as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;)

        inaturalist_has_name_information_for_mammals:  |
          %{site_name} has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
          and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
          database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
          alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
          name to the tags or description fields.
        how_can_i_get_help_identifying_what_i_saw?: How can I get help identifying what I saw?
        check_the_id_please_checkbox_when_html: | 
          Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
          observation and your observation will appear in
          <a href="%{url}">ID Please</a>.
        what_does_it_mean_to_link_inaturalist_to_my_flickr_account?: What does it mean to link %{site_name} to my Flickr account?
        inaturalist_can_link_directly_to_the_flickr_photo_service: | 
          %{site_name} can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
          that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
          you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
          two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
          you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
          to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
        can_i_add_photos_without_a_flickr_account?: Can I add photos without a Flickr account?
        we_also_support_picasa_html:  'We also support Picasa: <a href="%{url}">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>'
        we_also_support_uploading_photos: |
                We also support uploading photos directly to %{site_name}, but it can be a bit
                slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Picasa is
                probably faster if you already use those services.
        what_are_tags?:  What are tags?
        tags_are_keywords_you_can_add_to_an_html: |
          Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. 
          For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, 
          you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.
        can_i_include_my_observations_on_my_blog?: Can I include my %{site_name} observations on my own website of blog?

        what_kind_of_photos_should_i_attach: What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?
        photos_attached_to_observations_should_be: | 
          Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
          at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
          tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
          observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
          different point in time.
        please_do_not_upload_pictures_you_didnt_take_html: | 
          Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
          obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
          copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
          of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
          photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
          someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
          it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
          observation's description.
        what_is_geoprivacy?: What is geoprivacy?
        geoprivacy_is_a_setting_you_can: |
          Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
          controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
          displayed. Here are the options:
        note_that_curators_of: | 
          Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
          coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
          concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
          you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
        what_is_does_it_mean_for: What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?
        when_coordinates_are_obscured_it_means_that: |
          When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
          %{km}KM of the true coordinates 
          is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
          project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
          are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
          pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
          the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
          true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
          circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
        coordinates_are_obscured_for_all_taxa: | 
          Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
          THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
          declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
          some may be simply marked as threatened by %{site_name} site curators if they
          believe it merits protection.
        you_can_also_obscure_the_coordinates_html: | 
          You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
          regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.
        what_is_the_quality_assessment: What is the quality assessment and how do observations qualify to become "research" grade?
        what_is_a_life_list?: What is a life list?
        just_a_simple_list: Just a simple list of taxa with no special behavior.
        automatically_updates_based_on_your_observations: |
          Automatically updates based on your observations. Everyone on %{site_name}
          has a default life list that contains every species that person has
          observed. If you delete an observation or change your ID, the
          species will get removed. You can also manually add taxa to your
          life list just like you can with an ordinary list. The species you
          add manually won't get removed if you observe them and then delete
          the observation.
        you_can_also_make_additional_life_lists: |
          You can also make additional life lists for specific groups of
          organisms, like a life list of birds, or a life list of milkweeds.
        a_project_list_belongs: |
          A project list belongs to a project and lists all the taxa
          observed by members of that project. Project lists can also be
          populated manually by the admin of that project, and can be used
          to restrict project contributions to taxa that are on the list.
        a_check_list_is_html: |
          A check list is a list of taxa that occur in a place. Every place
          has a default check list, and whenever an observation is made
          within the place's boundaries <em>and</em> it has achieved
          research-grade status, the species observed will get automatically
          added to the place's check list.
        inat_users_can_also: |
          %{site_name} users can also add additional check lists to places, but
          these check lists are not automatically updated. They mainly
          provide a way for people to bring in outside sources of data or
          just list things based on their own experience.
        is_a_list_of_every_species_that_you_have_seen: |
          A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every %{site_name} user has a life 
          list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to %{site_name}.
        i_observed_a_species: "I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?"
        while_the_life_list_is_automatically_populated: |
                While the life list is automatically populated from added
                observations, the species will not be added to this list if
                %{site_name} does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
                trying alternative names that we might recognize.

          <p class="ui">
            The community taxon (or community identification) represents
            what taxon the %{site_name} community thinks is depicted in an
            observation. If you're interested in how we choose the
            community taxon, see the notes on the algorithm below, but in
            general, we try to <strong>choose a taxon that more than 2/3
            of the identifiers agree with</strong>. Sometimes this means
            choosing a higher level taxon that contains a number of
            disagreeing taxa (e.g. you think it's a kingsnake and I think
            it's rattlesnake, so iNat chooses suborder Serpentes which
            contains all snakes). The algorithm also slightly favors
            dissent, because we've found that dissenters are often
            correct.

            agree with the community taxon, you can reject it, which means
            that your ID is the one used for linking to other observations,
            updating life lists, etc. It also means your observation can only
            become research grade when the community agrees with <em>you</em>.

          500, since the two lists probably don't contain the same users.
          A value marked '*' means it wasn't in the top 500 for that stat.

          <p>
            Unlike regular projects, bioblitzes display event stats from
            <em>all</em> observations within a place and time period, not just
            observations that people have intentionally added to the project.
            This is to remove the hurdle of adding observations to a project
            just to drive the stats in real time. Note that observations won't
            be available for export or display on various project views such
            as member contributions on the website or project observation
            searches in the mobile apps unless the project team and
            participants actively add relevant observations like they would in
            a normal project.

          <p>
            Note that while this kind of project shows stats for observations that
            haven't been deliberately added to the project, it does not allow
            curators to see private or obscured coordinates for those
            observations or assume that observers have agreed to the project
            terms. If you're a project curator and you need access to private
            coordinates, you need your participants to agree to the project
            terms, or you want observations counted towards the curated project checklist,
            make sure your participants join the project and add their
            observations like they would in a normal project.

          %{site_name} tracks what you think your observations are and what
          the community thinks they are. The identification we share with data
          partners is the community identification, but if you don't think the
          community's opinion should ever overrule your own, you can opt out
          here. People will still be able to add identifications, but the
          community opinion won't be favored over yours. This means your
          observations will not be eligible for research grade unless you
          agree with the community.
