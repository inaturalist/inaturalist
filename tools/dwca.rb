    Exports a Darwin Core Archive from observations.  Archives will be gzip'd tarballs

    Usage:

      rails runner dwca.rb

    will output licensed observations to public/observations/dwca.zip.

      rails runner tools/dwca.rb -f public/observations/calflora.dwca.zip -t 123635 -p 14

    will output licensed observations of taxon 123635 from place 14 to calflora.dwca.zip

      rails runner tools/dwca.rb \
        -f public/taxa/eol_media.dwca.zip \
        --core taxon \
        --extensions EolMedia \
        --photo-licenses CC-BY CC-BY-NC CC-BY-SA CC-BY-NC-SA

    will output taxon records with the EolMedia extension from a limited set of photo
    licenses.

      rails runner tools/dwca.rb \
        -f public/taxa/CC-BY.dwca.zip \
        --license CC-BY \
        --licenses CC-BY

    will output observation records that have the CC BY license, and will license
    the entire archive under a CC BY license.
