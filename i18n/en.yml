  we_dont_host_photos_at:  We don't host photos at iNat, but we do allow you to associate your observations with photos from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Picasa</a>. If you use either of those services, you can link your accounts and always see a list of your most recent photos when adding new observations.

  link_your_picasa_account: Link your Picasa account
  link_your_facebook_account: Link your Facebook account
  inat_can_also_help_you_add: iNat can also help you add taxonomic tags to your Flickr photos using the
  this_tool_will_add_tags: tool. This tool will add tags to your photos for all the common and scientific names of the taxon you observed, and the names of its ancestor taxa. So if your observation is of a
  you_would_get_the: "you would get the following tags:"
  tags_like_taxonomy_binomial: Tags like <code>taxonomy:binomial=Pseudacris crucifer</code> are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/tags#613430">machine tags</a>.  They help engineers programmatically make sense of your tags, and are required by some Flickr groups like the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/encyclopedia_of_life/">Encyclopedia of Life Images</a> group.
  you_can_also_add_flickr: You can also add Flickr tags when editing an observation, or when batch editing your observations.
  lists_are_lists_of_species: Lists are lists of species (or other taxa), like a life list of all the birds you've seen or a list of your favorite salamanders.  They are <em>not</em> lists of observations.
  lists_come_in_three: "Lists come in three varieties:"
  dt_lists: <dt>Lists</dt> <dd> Ordinary lists are just arbitrary lists of taxa you can create. Maybe you'd like to keep a list of species you'd like to see, or birds you've seen at your bird feeder.  </dd>
  dt_life_list: <dt>Life Lists</dt> <dd> Life lists are automatically filled in based on your observations and a set of rules, and they can also be added to manually. At the moment, the only rule we support is whether or not a species in some higher level taxon. So you could make a life list of all the mammals you've seen by associating with the taxon <a href="/taxa/Mammalia">Mammalia</a>. Everyone on iNat has one life list by default which records all the taxa they've seen.  </dd>
  dt_check_lists: <dt>Check Lists</dt> <dd> Check lists represent all the taxa that occur within a particular place. Unlike ordinary lists and life lists, check lists can be edited by anyone on iNat. Since places can contain other places (e.g. Connecticut is a state in the USA), check lists automatically get updated by changes to contained places. So if I add "Northern Cardinal" to the checklist for Connecticut, it will get added to the USA checklist as well. Places can also have multiple checklists for different taxa (e.g. "Plants of Australia") that use taxonomic rules like life lists.  </dd>

#Quality metrics
  the_data_quality_assessment_is: The data quality assessment is a summary of an observation's accuracy. All observations start as <strong>"casual"</strong> grade, and achieve <strong>"research"</strong> grade when
  the_inat_community_agrees_with: the iNat <strong>community agrees with the observer's ID</strong>, where an "agreeing" identification is one that matches exactly or is of a child taxon of the observer's ID. For example, if Scott says it's a mammal and Ken-ichi says it's <em>Homo sapiens</em>, then Ken-ichi agrees with Scott.
  the_observation_has_date: the observation <strong>has a date</strong>
  the_observation_is_georeferenced: the observation <strong>is georeferenced</strong> (i.e. has lat/lon coordinates)
  the_observation_has_photo: the observation <strong>has a photo</strong>
  observations_will_revert_to_casual: Observations will revert to "casual" grade if the above conditions aren't met or
  the_community_agrees_location_doesnt: the community agrees the <strong>location doesn't looks accurate</strong> (e.g. monkeys in the middle of the ocean, hippos in office buildings, etc.)
  the_community_agrees_organism_isnt: the community agrees the <strong>organism isn't wild/naturalized</strong> (e.g. captive or cultivated by humans or intelligent space aliens)
  what_do_you_think: What do you think?
  yes: yes

  locked_taxa_will_not_allow_new: Locked taxa will not allow new descendent taxa to be added to them. So if you locked Amphibia and someone tried to import <i>Rana catesbeiana</i> from an external name provider, the new taxon would be created but it could not be classified as an amphibian. When this happens, the newly added taxa should be flagged for curator attention.  This should really only be used for taxa for which we think we already have all the descendants. Curator can override this by editing taxa and entering parent IDs directly, but please consider merging new taxa into existing ones instead.

  faq: Frequently Asked Questions
  general: General
  what_is_inaturalist: What is iNaturalist?
  inaturalist_provides_a_place_to: |
          iNaturalist provides a place to record and organize nature findings,
          meet other nature enthusiasts, and learn about the natural world. It
          encourages the participation of a wide variety of nature
          enthusiasts, including, but not exclusive to, hikers, hunters,
          birders, beach combers, mushroom foragers, park rangers, ecologists,
          and fishermen. Through connecting these different perceptions and
          expertise of the natural world, iNaturalist hopes to create
          extensive community awareness of local biodiversity and promote
          further exploration of local environments.
  who_is_behind_inaturalist: Who is behind iNaturalist?

  inaturalist_is_built_using: |
          iNat software is built using <a
          href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a
          href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a
          href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a
          href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps//">Google Maps</a>, and <a
          href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. It also utilizes the <a
          href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org">Catalogue of Life</a> and
          <a href="http://ubio.org/">uBio</a> data sources for taxonomic data.
  what_can_i_do_to_help_inaturalist: What can I do to help iNaturalist?
  you_can_help_inaturalist_by_giving_us_your_feedback: |
          You can help iNaturalist by giving us your feedback; join our 
          <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/inaturalist">Google group</a> 
          to sign up for usability studies, report bugs, and request new
          features. You can also help iNaturalist by adding your observations
          and helping other community members identify their unidentified
          observations. If you know how to code and want to help work on some
          features,
          <a href="http://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist" title="inaturalist's inaturalist at master - GitHub">fork us on GitHub</a>!
  how_do_i_contact_inaturalist: How do I contact iNaturalist?
  you_can_contact_us_at_: You can contact us at <a href="mailto:<%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %>"><%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %></a>"
  what_are_admins_and_curators: What are admins and curators?
  inat_admins_are_the_people_who: |
          iNat admins are the people who run the site. They have direct access
          to the underlying code and the database, and they can change anything
          on the site.
  curators_are_inat_users_who_volunteer_to: |
          Curators are iNat users who volunteer to help keep our taxonomic data
          up to date. If you're interested in becoming a curator, please 
          <a href="mailto:<%= APP_CONFIG[:help_email] %>">contact us</a>. Curators can
          also promote other users to curator status. Please only promote people
          you trust and that you know to have some taxonomic knowledge."
  what_is_considered_inappropriate_content: What is considered inappropriate content?
  you_know_it_when_you_see_it: | 
          You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">know it when you see it</a>, 
          right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
          is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
          the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
          probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
          animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
          interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
          that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
          nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth
          flagging and may be deleted, but evidence of pollution or disturbance
          could be interesting, and probably won't be removed.
  observations: Observations
  what_is_an_observation?: What is an observation?
  an_observation_is_the_what_where_and_when: An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. iNaturalist provides a place to add this information along with associated text, photos, and tags. iNaturalist encourages the recording of all nature findings, whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. (In iNaturalist the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;.)
  why_doesnt_inaturalist_recognize_the_name_ive_entered: Why doesn't iNaturalist recognize the name I've entered?
  inaturalist_has_name_information_for_mammals:  |
          iNaturalist has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
          and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
          database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
          alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
          name to the tags or description fields.
  how_can_i_get_help_identifying_what_i_saw: How can I get help identifying what I saw?
  check_the_id_please_checkbox_when: | 
          Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
          observation and your observation will appear in
          <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/id_please" title="<%= APP_CONFIG[:site_name] %> &middot; ID Please!">ID Please</a>.
  what_does_it_mean_to_link_inaturalist_to_my_flickr_account: What does it mean to link iNaturalist to my Flickr account?
  inaturalist_can_link_directly_to_the_flickr_photo_service: | 
          iNaturalist can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
          that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
          you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
          two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
          you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
          to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
  can_i_add_photos_without_a_flickr_account: Can I add photos without a Flickr account?
  we_also_support_picasa:  'We also support Picasa: <a href="http://inaturalist.org/picasa/options">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>'
  we_also_support_uploading_photos: |
          We also support uploading photos directly to iNat, but it can be a bit
          slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Picasa is
          probably faster if you already use those services.
  what_are_tags:  What are tags?
  tags_are_keywords_you_can_add_to_an: Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.
  can_i_include_my_observations_on_my_blog?: Can I include my iNat observations on my own website of blog?
  sure_check_out_our_widget: Sure, check out our <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/widget" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
  what_kind_of_photos_should_i_attach: What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?
  photos_attached_to_observations_should_be: | 
          Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
          at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
          tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
          observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
          different point in time.
  please_do_not_upload_pictures_you_didnt_take: | 
          Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
          obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
          copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
          of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
          photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
          someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
          it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
          observation's description.
  what_is_geoprivacy?: What is geoprivacy?
  geoprivacy_is_a_setting_you_can: |
          Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
          controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
          displayed. Here are the options:
  note_that_curators_of: | 
          Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
          coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
          concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
          you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
  what_is_does_it_mean_for: What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?
  when_coordinates_are_obscured_it_means_that: |
          When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
          <%= Observation::M_TO_OBSCURE_THREATENED_TAXA / 1000 %>KM of the true coordinates 
          is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
          project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
          are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
          pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
          the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
          true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
          circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
  coordinates_are_obscured_for_all_taxa: | 
          Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
          THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
          declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
          some may be simply marked as threatened by iNat site curators if they
          believe it merits protection.
  you_can_also_obscure_the_coordinates: | 
          You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
          regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.
  what_is_the_quality_assessment: What is the quality assessment and how do observations qualify to become "research" grade?
